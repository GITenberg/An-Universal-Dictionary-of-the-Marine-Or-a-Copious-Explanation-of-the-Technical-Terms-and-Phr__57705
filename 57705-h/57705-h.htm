  <h2 id='PREFACE' class='c006'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The following work has engaged my utmost application
for some years. Several performances on
the same subject have already appeared; as Sir H. Manwaring’s
<cite>Seaman’s Dictionary</cite>; Boteler’s <cite>Sea Dialogues</cite>;
Guillet’s <cite>Gentleman’s Dictionary</cite>, and Blanckley’s <cite>Naval
Expositor</cite>, &amp;c. Far from exhibiting an enlarged and
comprehensive view of naval affairs, these productions
are extremely imperfect, according to the very circumscribed
plan which their authors have adopted. There
are besides, the <cite>Dictionaire de Marine</cite> of M. Aubin, published
in Holland; and that of M. Saverien, published
in France. These are indeed voluminous, but very deficient
in the most necessary articles. Besides a circumstantial
detail of the local oeconomy of different marine
departments, they are swelled out with astronomy,
navigation, hydrography, natural history, &amp;c. all of
which are abundantly better treated in other compositions.
Of the machinery of a ship; the disposition
of the rigging on her masts and yards; and the comparative
force of her different mechanical powers, their
accounts however are often vague, perplexed, and unintelligible.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to her internal government in
action; to the general regulations of the line of battle;
and to the principal movements in sailing, they
are almost totally silent. Had any of these works
been executed with tolerable success, it might have
rendered mine unnecessary; or probably have introduced
it in the form of a translation.</p>

<p class='c008'>I  acknowledge with great pleasure the advantages I
have derived in the prosecution of this work, from several
authors of distinguished reputation: in reality however
none of those above-mentioned are of the number. In
that part which is dedicated to the theory and art of
ship-building, I owe considerable obligations to the ingenious
M. Du Hamel. The principal pieces used in
the construction of a ship, together with their combination
and disposition, are copiously and accurately described
in his <cite>Elements of Naval Architecture</cite>: and his
general account of the art itself is perspicuous and
comprehensive. Many of his explanations I have therefore
implicitly adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>In treating of the artillery, I have occasionally consulted
<cite>Le Blond</cite>, <cite>Muller</cite>, and <cite>Robins</cite>, besides selecting
some valuable materials from the manuscripts of officers
of long experience and established reputation in that
service. Whatever relates to the rigging, sails, machinery,
and movements of a ship; or to the practice of
naval war, is generally drawn from my own observations;
unless where the author is quoted.</p>

<p class='c008'>As there are abundance of books professedly written
on astronomy, and the theory of navigation, I have
totally omitted the terms of the former, as foreign to my
plan; and slightly passed over the latter: because no
reader could acquire a sufficient idea of those sciences
from so partial a description. Many of the least important
parts of a ship, as well as of her rigging, are very
generally defined. To explain the track of every particular
rope, through its different channels, would be
equally useless and unintelligible to a land reader: to
mariners it were superfluous: and even the youths who
are trained to the sea, would reap little advantage from
it; because their situation affords them much better opportunities
of making these minute discoveries.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have in general endeavoured to give the etymology
of the most material expressions, unless when their evident
analogy to common words rendered this unnecessary.
Many reasons may be alledged for introducing the
French sea-terms and phrases; particularly that obvious
one, of understanding their pilots, when we may have occasion
for their assistance. Wherever it was found necessary
to explain one technical term by another, the
latter is usually printed in italics the first time it is mentioned;
so that the reader may refer to it for a further
explanation.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the plates of this publication were intended to illustrate
the various objects to which they refer, they are
little ornamented; but have in general the recommendation
of simplicity and geometrical truth. In this part I
have been particularly favoured with many original drawings,
which are usually considered amongst the inaccessible
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcana</span></i> of ship-building. They are much more numerous,
useful, and correct, than what has hitherto appeared
in any work of the kind. In fine, I have endeavoured,
to the best of my judgment, to retrench the
superfluities, and supply the deficiences of former writers
on the same subject, as well as to digest and methodise
whatever appeared loose or inaccurate therein.</p>

<p class='c008'>This undertaking was first suggested to me by my
worthy and ingenious friend George Lewis Scott, Esq;
who considered it as a work of extensive utility, Indeed,
in a country whose principal sources of strength
are derived from the superiority of her marine, it is
evidently wanted. I have the pleasure also to know that
Sir Edward Hawke, and several officers of respectable abilities
in our navy, are of the same opinion. To this
may be added, what the celebrated M. Du Hamel lately
observed, in a letter to me, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">s</span></i>. I mention this expressly,
because some sea-officers have considered the work unnecessary.
It is however submitted, with all possible deference,
to superior judges; to men of science and letters,
who know the difficulty of explaining the parts of a
mechanical system, when the readers are unacquainted
with the subject.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>ABACK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coeffé</span></i>, the situation of the sails when their surfaces
are flatted against the masts by the force of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sails are said to be <i>taken aback</i>, when they are brought
into this situation, either by a sudden change of the wind, or by an
alteration in the ship’s course. They are <i>laid aback</i>, to effect an immediate
retreat, without turning to the right or left; or, in the sea-phrase,
to give the ship <i>stern-way</i>, in order to avoid some danger discovered
before her in a narrow channel; or when she has advanced
beyond her station in the line of battle, or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sails are placed in this position by slackening their lee-braces,
and hauling in the weather ones; so that the whole effort of the wind
is exerted on the fore-part of their surface, which readily pushes the
ship astern, unless she is restrained by some counter-acting force. See
<span class='sc'>Backing</span>, and <span class='sc'>Bracing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is also usual to spread some sail aback near the stern, as the mizen-top-sail,
when a ship rides with a single anchor in a road, in order to prevent
her from approaching it so as to entangle the flukes of it with her
slackened cable, and thereby loosen it from the ground. See <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 1. Plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. discovers the plan of a ship, <i>a b</i>, with her main-top-sail,
<i>c d</i>, aback; in which the curved dotted line expresses the cavity
of it, as blown back by the wind on each side of the mast. The fore-top-sail,
which is full, is exhibited by the line <i>e f</i>. Fig. 3. represents a
perspective view of the ship in the same situation; and the dart shews
the direction of the wind upon both.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lay all flat</i> <span class='sc'>Aback</span>, the order to arrange all the sails in this situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>ABAFT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arriere</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">abaftan</span></i>, Sax. behind) the hinder part of a ship, or
all those parts both within and without, which lie towards the stern,
in opposition to afore; which see.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Abaft</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arriere de</span></i>, is also used as a preposition, and signifies <i>further aft</i>,
or <i>nearer the stern</i>; as, the barricade stands <i>abaft</i> the main mast, i. e. behind
it, or nearer the stern.</p>

<p class='c008'>ABOARD (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à bord</span></i>, Fr. <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">abordo</span></i>, Ital.) the inside of a ship: hence any
person who enters a ship is said to go <i>aboard</i>: but when an enemy enters
in the time of battle, he is said to <i>board</i>. A phrase which always
implies hostility. See the article <span class='sc'>Boarding</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>To fall <span class='sc'>Aboard</span> of, <i>aborder</i>, to strike or encounter another ship, when,
one or both are in motion; to be driven upon a ship by the force of the
wind or current.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Aboard</span>-<i>main-tack!</i> <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amure la grande voile!</span></i> the order to draw the main-tack,
i. e. the lower corner of the main-sail, down to the chess-tree.
See <span class='sc'>Chess-tree</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>ABOUT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reviré</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">abutan</span></i>, Sax.) the situation of a ship immediately
after she has <i>tacked</i> or changed her course by going about, and standing
on the other tack. See <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>About-Ship!</span> <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">adieu-va!</span></i> the order to the ship’s crew to prepare for
tacking.</p>

<p class='c008'>ABREAST, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par le travers</span></i> (of <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">breost</span></i>, Sax.), side by side, or opposite to;
a situation in which two or more ships lie, with their sides parallel to
each other, and their heads equally advanced.</p>

<p class='c008'>This term more particularly regards the line of battle at sea, where,
on the different occasions of attack, retreat, or pursuit, the several squadrons,
or divisions of a fleet, are obliged to vary their dispositions, and
yet maintain a proper regularity by sailing in <i>right</i> or <i>curved</i> lines. When
the line is formed <i>abreast</i>, the whole squadron advances uniformly, the
ships being equally distant from, and parallel to each other, so that the
length of each ship forms a right angle with the extent of the squadron
or line <i>abreast</i>. The commander in chief is always stationed in
the center, and the second and third in command in the centers of their
respective squadrons. See this farther illustrated in the article <span class='sc'>Line</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Abreast</span>, within the ship, implies on a line with the beam, or by
the side of any object aboard; as, the frigate sprung a leak abreast
of the main hatch-way, i. e. on the same line with the main hatch-way,
crossing the ship’s length at right angles, in opposition to <i>afore</i> or <i>abaft</i>
the hatch-way. See <span class='sc'>Abaft</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>We discovered a fleet <span class='sc'>Abreast</span> of Beachy-Head</i>, i. e. off, or directly opposite
thereto.</p>

<p class='c008'>ACORN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pomme de girouette</span></i>, a little ornamental piece of wood, fashioned
like a cone, and fixed on the uppermost point of the spindle,
above the vane, on the mast-head. It is used to keep the vane from
being blown off from the spindle in a whirlwind, or when the ship leans
much to one side under sail. See plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. fig. 1. where <i>a</i> represents the
acorn, <i>b</i> the vane and stock, <i>c</i> the spindle, and <i>d</i> the mast-head.</p>

<p class='c008'>ADMIRAL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amiral</span></i>, an officer of the first rank and command in the
fleet, and who is distinguished by a flag displayed at his main-top-mast-head.
Also an officer who superintends the naval forces of a nation,
and who is authorised to determine in all maritime causes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The origin and denomination of this important office, which seems
to have been established in most countries that border on the sea, have
given rise to a great variety of opinions. Some have borrowed them
from the Greek, others from the Arabic, while a third sort, with greater
probability, derive both the title and dignity from the Saracens.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> But
since no certain conclusions have been deduced from these elaborate
researches, and as it rather appears the province of this work to give
the reader an idea of the office and duty of an admiral at sea, than to
furnish an historical or chronological detail of the rank and power with
which admirals have been invested in different nations, we shall contentedly
resign this task to the ingenious lexicographers who have so
repeatedly entertained us with such critical investigations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Admiral</span>, or commander in chief of a fleet, being frequently
invested with a great charge, on which the fate of a kingdom may depend,
ought certainly to be possessed of abilities equal to so important
a station and so extensive a command. His fleet is unavoidably exposed
to a variety of perplexing situations in a precarious element. A train of
dangerous incidents necessarily arise from those situations. The health,
order, and discipline of his people, are not less the objects of his consideration,
than the condition and qualities of his ships. A sudden
change of climate, a rank and infectious air, a scarcity, or unwholsomness
of provisions, may be as pernicious to the former, as tempestuous
weather or dangerous navigation to the latter. A lee-shore, an injudicious
engagement with an enemy greatly superior, may be equally
fatal to both. He ought to have sufficient experience to anticipate all
the probable events that may happen to his fleet during an expedition
or cruise, and, by consequence, to provide against them. His skill
should be able to counter-act the various disasters which his fleet may
suffer from different causes. His vigilance and presence of mind are
necessary to seize every favourable opportunity that his situation may
offer to prosecute his principal design; to extricate himself from
any difficulty or distress; to check unfortunate events in the beginning,
and retard the progress of any great calamity. He should be
endued with resolution and fortitude to animate his officers by the force
of example, and promote a sense of emulation in those who are under his
command, as well to improve any advantage, as to frustrate or defeat
the efforts of his ill fortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most essential part of his duty, however, appears to be military
conduct. As soon as the fleet under his command puts to sea, he is to
form it into the proper order of battle, called the <span class='sc'>Line</span>. In this arrangement
he is to make a judicious distribution of strength from the
van to the rear, throwing the principal force into the center, to resist
the impression of the enemy’s fleet; which might otherwise, at some
favourable opportunity, break through his line, and throw the van and
rear into confusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>A competent knowledge of the seas, weather, and reigning winds, of
the coast or region where he is stationed, is also requisite, as it will
greatly facilitate his plans on the enemy. It will enable him to avoid
being improperly embayed, where he might be surprised in a disadvantageous
situation; and to judge whether it will be most expedient to
attack his adversary, or lie prepared to receive his assault. When his
fleet is forced by stress of weather or otherwise to take shelter in a road
or bay, it will likewise suggest the necessary conduct of keeping a sufficient
number of cruisers at sea, to bring him early intelligence, that
they may be ready to cut or slip the cables when they are too much hurried
to weigh their anchors.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the forming a complete, strong, and uniform line is a very material
article in naval war, the admiral ought frequently to arrange the
fleet under his command into this order, that the inferior officers may
observe to bring their ships, with greater dexterity and alertness, into
their several stations, and maintain the regularity of the line when they
tack, veer, or sail abreast. See <span class='sc'>Line</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the admiral intends a descent on an enemy’s coast, or other attack
which may be attended with complicated and unforeseen incidents,
his orders should be delivered or drawn up with the greatest accuracy
and precision: they should be simple, perspicuous, direct, and comprehensive;
they should collect a number of objects into one point of view,
and, foreseeing the effects of success or defeat, appoint the proper measures
to be adopted in consequence thereof. History and experience
confirm the necessity of this observation, and present us with a variety of
disasters that have happened on such occasions, merely by a deficiency
in this material article. In the commanding officer, inattention, barrenness
of expedient, or a circumscribed view of the necessary effects
of his enterprize, may be equally pernicious. And general orders ought
to be utterly free from pedantry and perplexity, which always betray
a false taste and confused imagination, besides the probability of producing
many fatal consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'>When an admiral conquers in battle, he should endeavour to improve
his victory, by pushing the advantages he has acquired as far as
prudence directs; a conduct which merits his attention as much as any
in the action! When he is defeated, he ought to embrace every opportunity
of saving as many of his ships as possible, and endeavour principally
to assist those which are disabled. In short, it is his duty to avail
himself of every practicable expedient rather than sink under his misfortune,
and suffer himself to become an easy prey to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>He should be sufficiently acquainted with civil law, to judge with
propriety of the proceedings of courts-martial, and to correct the errors,
and restrain the abuses which may happen therein by mistake, or ignorance,
or inattention.</p>

<p class='c008'>As secret treaties, propositions, or schemes of the enemy, may occasionally
be submitted to his inspection, or fall into his possession by capture;
and which it might be improper to discover to any person near
him, he ought to have a competent knowledge of the modern languages,
or at least, those of the countries against whom his military operations
are directed, to be able to comprehend with facility the full scope
and purport of such papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>He ought to be well versed in geometry, to order proper and correct
surveys of unknown coasts, roads, or harbours to be made, and to
judge of their accuracy, and detect their errors. To ascertain the
situation and longitude of different places, he should be also sufficiently
skilled in astronomy, and the method of taking observations, which
indeed is essentially necessary to the profession of a sea-officer, although
too much neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'>By his orders the admiral is likewise to assist at all councils of war that
relate to naval affairs: to visit, as often as convenient, the other
ships of his squadron: to enquire particularly into their condition, and
observe the men mustered, taking care that no supernumeraries are
borne on the books. He is directed to acquaint the secretary of the
admiralty of all his proceedings relating to the service, for the information
of the lord-high-admiral, or lords commissioners of the admiralty;
and to attend him or them, on his return home, with an account
of his voyage or expedition, and to transmit a copy of his journal to
their secretary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much more might be observed on this occasion. It appears however by
the general outline which we have sketched, that the office and duty of an
admiral requires greater skill and more comprehensive abilities than is
generally supposed necessary to the command of a naval armament.
And that he ought to be duly qualified, at least in this kingdom, to
assist at the councils of his sovereign, and enter into the enlarged system
of protecting his country from an invasion by sea, or of meditating a
descent on an enemy’s coast; as well as to improve navigation, and
open new channels of commerce. For further particulars of his charge,

<p class='c008'>ALOOF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lof</span></i>, this has frequently been mentioned as a sea-term, but
whether justly or not we shall not presume to determine; it is known
in common discourse to imply, at a distance; and the resemblance of the
phrases, <i>keep aloof</i>, and <i>keep a luff</i>, or <i>keep the luff</i>, in all probability gave
rise to this conjecture. If it was really a sea-phrase originally, it seems
to have referred to the dangers of a lee-shore, in which situation the
pilot might naturally apply it in the sense commonly understood, <i>viz.</i>
keep <i>all off</i>, or quite off: it is, however, never expressed in that manner
by seamen now. See <span class='sc'>Luff</span>. It may not be improper to observe,

<p class='c008'>ANCHOR, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancre</span></i> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">anchora</span></i>, Lat. from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αγκυρα</span>, Greek) a heavy, strong,
crooked instrument of iron, dropped from a ship into the bottom of
the water, to retain her in a convenient station in a harbour, road, or
river.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most ancient anchors are said to have been of stone, and sometimes
of wood, to which a great quantity of lead was usually fixed.
In some places baskets full of stones, and sacks filled with sand, were
employed for the same use. All these were let down by cords into the
sea, and by their weight stayed the course of the ship. Afterwards they
were composed of iron, and furnished with teeth, which being fastened
to the bottom of the sea, preserved the vessel immoveable; whence
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀδοντες</span> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dentes</span></i> are frequently taken for anchors in the Greek and Latin
poets. At first there was only one tooth, whence anchors were called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐτερόστομοι</span>; but in a short time the second was added by Eupalamus, or
Anacharsis, the Scythian philosopher. The anchors with two teeth
were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίβολοι</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίστομοι</span>, and from ancient monuments appear
to have been much the same with those used in our days, only the transverse
piece of wood upon their handles (the stock) is wanting in all of
them. Every ship had several anchors, one of which, surpassing all the
rest in bigness and strength, was peculiarly termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱηρὰ</span>, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacra</span></i>, and was
never used but in extreme danger; whence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacram anchoram solvere</span></i>, is proverbially
applied to such as are forced to their last refuge. <cite>Potter’s Antiquities
of Greece.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>The anchors now made are contrived so as to sink into the ground as
soon as they reach it, and to hold a great strain before they can be
loosened or dislodged from their station. They are composed of a shank,
a stock, a ring, and two arms with their flukes. The stock, which is
a long piece of timber fixed across the shank, serves to guide the flukes
in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the ground; so that one of
them sinks into it by its own weight as soon as it falls, and is still preserved
steadily in that position by the stock, which, together with the
shank, lies flat on the bottom. In this situation it must necessarily
sustain a great effort before it can be dragged through the earth horizontally.
Indeed this can only be effected by the violence of the wind
or tide, or of both of them, sometimes increased by the turbulence of the
sea, and acting upon the ship so as to stretch the cable to its utmost tension,
which accordingly may dislodge the anchor from its bed, especially
if the ground be soft and oozy or rocky. When the anchor is thus displaced,
it is said, in the sea phrase, to <i>come home</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the figure of this useful instrument may be more clearly understood,
let us suppose a long massy beam of iron erected perpendicularly,
Plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. fig. 2. <i>b c</i>; at the lower end of which are two arms, <i>d</i> <i>e</i>, of equal
thickness with the beam (usually called the shank) only that they taper
towards the points, which are elevated above the horizontal plane at an
angle of thirty degrees; or inclined to the shank at an angle of sixty
degrees: on the upper part of each arm (in this position) is a fluke, or
thick plate of iron, <i>g h</i>, commonly shaped like an isosceles triangle,
whose base reaches inwards to the middle of the arm. On the upper-end
of the shank is fixed the stock transversely with the flukes: the stock
is a long beam of oak, <i>f</i>, in two parts, strongly bolted, and hooped
together with iron rings. See also fig. 3. Close above the stock is the
ring, <i>a</i>, to which the cable is fastened, or <i>bent</i>: the ring is curiously
covered with a number of pieces of short rope, which are twisted about
it so as to form a very thick texture or covering, called the puddening,
and used to preserve the cable from being fretted or chafed by the
iron.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every ship has, or ought to have, three principal anchors, with a
cable to each, viz. the sheet, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maitresse-ancre</span></i>, (which is the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">anchora sacra</span></i>
of the antients) the best bower, <i>second ancre</i>, and small bower, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancre d’ affourche</span></i>,
so called from their usual situation on the ship’s bows. There
are besides smaller anchors, for removing a ship from place to place in a
harbour or river, where there may not be room or wind for sailing;
these are the stream-anchor, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancre de touei</span></i>; the kedge and grappling,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grapin</span></i>; this last, however, is chiefly designed for boats.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To drag the</i> <span class='sc'>Anchors</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasser sur ses ancres</span></i>, implies the effort of making
the anchor <i>come home</i>, when the violence of the wind, &amp;c. strains the
cable so as to tear it up from the bed into which it had sunk, and
drag it along the ground; as already explained.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Foul</i>-<span class='sc'>Anchor</span>: it is so called when it either hooks some other anchor,
wreck, or cable, under the surface of the water; or when, by the wind
suddenly abating, the ship slackens her strain, and straying round the
bed of her anchor, entangles her slack cable about the upper fluke of it,
and easily draws it out of its place, as soon as she begins to ride with a
strain. To prevent this, it is usual, as she approaches the anchor, in light
winds, to draw the slack cable into the ship as fast as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancrer</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouiller</span></i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> is to let go the anchor, and to let
the ship ride thereby.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The</i> <span class='sc'>Anchor</span> <i>is a cock-bill</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancre est àla vielle</span></i>, implies that the shank-painter,
or rope by which the flukes were hung to the ship’s bow, being cast
off, the flukes drop down perpendicularly; whilst the anchor is suspended
at the cat-head by its stopper, ready to be sunk from the bow at a moment’s
warning.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To sheer the ship to her</i> <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouverner sur l’ancre</span></i>, is to steer the ship’s
head towards the place where the anchor lies when they are heaving the
cable into the ship; that the cable may thereby enter the hause with less
resistance, and the ship advance towards the anchor with greater facility.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To shoe the</i> <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>. See the article <span class='sc'>Shoe</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To weigh the</i> <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lever l’ancre</span></i>, to heave the anchor out of the
ground by its cable. See <span class='sc'>Capstern</span> and <span class='sc'>Windlass</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To weigh the</i> <span class='sc'>Anchor</span> <i>with the long-boat</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lever l’ancre avec la chaloupe</span></i>, is
to draw it up by applying mechanical powers to the buoy-rope, and
thereby pull it up to the boat’s stem or stern.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To weigh the</i> <span class='sc'>Anchor</span> <i>by the hair</i>, is to weigh it by the cable in a boat,
when the ship cannot approach it, or when the buoy rope is broke. See
the French term <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ancre</span></i>, and the phrases which succeed in order.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Anchor</span>-<i>ground</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fond de bonne tenue</span></i>, is a bottom which is neither too
deep, too shallow, nor rocky; as in the first the cable bears too nearly
perpendicular, and is thereby apt to jerk the anchor out of the ground:
in the second, the ship’s bottom is apt to strike at low water, or when
the sea runs high, by which she is exposed to the danger of sinking:
and in the third, the anchor is liable to hook the broken and pointed
ends of rocks, and tear away its flukes; whilst the cable, from the same
cause, is constantly in danger of being cut through as it rubs on their
edges.</p>

<p class='c008'>APEEK, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à pique</span></i>, Fr.) perpendicular to the anchor; a ship is said to be
in this situation, when the cable is drawn so tight into the bow as to,
bring her directly over the anchor, so that the cable bears right down
from the ship’s stem.</p>

<p class='c008'>APRON, (from <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">a</span></i> and <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">foran</span></i>, Sax.) a platform, or flooring of plank,
raised at the entrance of a dock, a little higher than the bottom,
against which the dock gates are shut. See the article <span class='sc'>Dock</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Apron</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre etrave</span></i>, in ship-building, a piece of curved timber fixed
behind the lower part of the stem, immediately above the foremost end
of the keel. See plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. fig. H. in the <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Apron</span> conforms exactly to the shape of the stem, so that when
the convexity of the former is applied to the concavity of the latter, it
forms one solid piece, which serves to fortify the stem, and give it a
firmer connexion with the keel.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the apron is composed of two pieces scarfed together, and used to
support she scarf of the stem, it is necessary that the scarf thereof should
be at some distance from that of the stem. It is formed of the same
thickness with the heel of the stem; but its thickness is equal throughout.
Sometimes the piece immediately under the apron forms a curve,
of which the horizontal part covers the dead-wood, whilst the vertical
part corresponds with the inside of the stem, to which it is fayed, making
the commencement of the apron.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Apron</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">platine</span></i>, is also a square piece of lead fastened over the touch-hole
of the cannon, to keep the charge dry at sea or in rainy weather.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Naval</i> ARCHITECTURE, or the science of ship-building, comprehends
the theory of delineating marine vessels upon a plane; and the
art of framing them upon the stocks, according to the proportions exhibited
in a regular design.</p>

<p class='c008'>All edifices, whether civil or military, are known to be erected in
consequence of certain established plans, which have been previously
altered or improved till they have arrived at the desired point of perfection.
The construction of ships appears also to require at least as
much correctness and precision as the buildings which are founded
upon <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</span></i>: it is therefore absolutely necessary that the mechanical
skill of the shipwright should be assisted by plans and sections, which
have been drawn with all possible exactness, examined by proper calculations,
and submitted to the most accurate scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>, or ship-building, may be distinguished into
three principal parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, To give the ship such an exterior form as may be most suitable
to the service for which she is designed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Secondly, to give the various pieces of a ship their proper figures; to
assemble and unite them into a firm, compact frame, so that by their
combination and disposition they may form a solid fabric, sufficient to
answer all the purposes for which it is intended: And,</p>

<p class='c008'>Thirdly, To provide convenient accommodations for the officers and
crew, as well as suitable apartments for the cargo, furniture, provisions,
artillery and ammunition.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exterior figure of a ship may be divided into the bottom and
upper-works.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bottom, or quick-work, contains what is termed the <i>hold</i>, and
which is under water when the ship is laden. The upper-works, called
also the dead-work, comprehend all that part which is usually above the
water when the ship is laden.</p>

<p class='c008'>The figure of the bottom is therefore determined by the qualities
which are necessary for the vessel, and conformable to the service for
which she is proposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The limits of our design will not admit of a minute description,
and enumeration of all the pieces of timber which enter into the construction
of a ship, nor of a particular description of their assemblage
and union; or the manner in which they reciprocally contribute to the
solidity of those floating citadels. It nevertheless appears necessary
to give a general idea of the use, figure, and station, of the principal
pieces, to those who are intirely unacquainted with the subject. As our
definitions will be greatly illustrated also by the proper figures, we have
annexed to this article a plate which comprehends some of the most
material draughts, as well as a representation of the principal pieces employed
in naval architecture.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usual amongst shipwrights to delineate three several draughts.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, The whole length of the ship is represented according to a side
view, perpendicular to the keel, and is termed the plane of elevation, or
sheer-draught. Plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Second, The ship is exhibited according to an end view, and stripped
of her planks, so as to present the outlines of the principal timbers; and
this is properly termed the plane of projection, or the vertical plane
of the timbers, Plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. because it shews the projection of their frames relatively
to each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Third, It is not sufficient to have the vertical curves of the bottom in
different places, for a distinct idea of the horizontal curves is also equally
necessary and useful: this is obtained by means of <i>water-lines</i>, traced
upon what is called the horizontal plane. In this draught, the curves of
the transoms called the <i>round-aft</i>, is also marked, and sometimes the
breadth and thickness of the timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plane of elevation, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. determines the length and depth
of the keel; the difference of the draughts of water; the length and
projection, or <i>rake</i>, of the stem and stern-post; the position of the
mid-ship frame upon the keel, together with that of the principal frames
afore and abaft; the load-water-line; the wales, the dimensions and
situations of the gun-ports, the projection of the rails of the head and
stern-gallery, with the stations of the masts and channels. See the
article <span class='sc'>Elevation</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>This draught, however, conveys no idea of the vertical curve of the
ribs or timbers; for as their projection will be only represented in
a plane elevated upon the length of the keel, they will appear in this
direction no otherwise than as streight lines. To perceive these curves
accurately, they must be regarded in another point of view, which will
represent their projection upon a vertical plane, supposed to cut the keel
at right angles in the place where the ship is broadest. For as all ships
are broader near the middle of their length than towards the extremities,
it is evident that the timbers are more extended in proportion. The
most capacious of these represents what is called the <i>midship-frame</i>;
and upon the area of this frame is delineated the projection of all the
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the plane of projection limits the different breadths of a ship in
various points of her length, and exhibits the outline of the timbers
respectively to each other, as they are erected upon the keel. Accordingly,
this draught ought to present a variety of sections of the ship in
different places of her length, and always perpendicular to the surface of
the water; so that the eye of the observer, when placed in what may be
properly termed the <i>axis</i> of the ship, may perceive the several sections at
one glance, that is to say, when looking full on the stem, from before
the ship, (See plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. fig. 4.) he shall discover the fore-timbers; and
when looking from behind, directly on the stern, he shall perceive
the form of the after-timbers, (See plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. fig. 2 and 3.) in both of which
figures the sections of the inferior timbers are expressed by curved black
lines drawn upon the area of the midship-frame, which is already described
to be a plane elevated perpendicularly upon the keel at the extreme
breadth of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>To form a just idea of this plane, therefore, we ought to suppose a
ship resting upon the stocks, in the same position as when afloat upon
the water. Thus a variety of black vertical lines may be drawn at
equal distances upon the bottom, which is white, to form different outlines
of the ship corresponding to the timbers within. It is to be observed,
that the fashion of the inferior timbers must conform to the figure of the
midship-frame, which is placed in the fullest part of the ship; and as the
planes of all the other timbers diminish in a certain progression as they
approach the stem and stern, they are properly delineated on the plane
of the midship-frame, which also represents the depth of the keel and
length of the midship-beam.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the two sides of a ship ought to be exactly alike, it is judged sufficient
to represent the sections of the fore-part of the ship on the left
side, and those in the after-part on the right side, so as to perceive all the
sections, as well afore as abaft, upon one plane. See plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Projection</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>However necessary it may be to understand precisely the vertical
curves of the bottom, it is no less requisite to have a just idea of those
which are horizontal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The horizontal, or floor plane, is that upon which the whole frame
is erected, and will be more clearly understood by previously describing
the water-lines and ribbands, of which it is composed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship floats upon the stream, it is evident that her upper-works
will be separated from the bottom by the surface of the water,
which will accordingly describe an imaginary horizontal line upon the
bottom from the stem to the stern-post.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most elevated of those lines is termed the load-water-line, which
is supposed to be drawn by the surface of the water on the upper part of
the bottom, when she is sufficiently laden for a sea-voyage. For if we
suppose this surface a rule, and thereby describe a corresponding black
line along the vessel’s bottom, that line will be distinguished upon the
bottom, which is white, and represent what is called the load-water-line.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the ship is lightened of any part of her lading, and preserves the
same difference in her draught of water at the two ends, or, what is
the same thing, if she is lightened so as to preserve the same equilibrium
of the keel with regard to the surface of the water, it is evident that she
will rise higher out of the water, so that the black line already described
will be elevated above it, and another black line may be delineated upon
the bottom, close to the surface of the water, which will exhibit a
second water-line parallel to the first, but nearer the keel in proportion
to the number of feet which the ship has risen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus by lightening a ship gradually, and at the same time preserving
the direction of her keel, or the angle which the keel makes with the
surface of the water, a variety of water-lines may be drawn parallel to
each other, and to the load-water-line. See a farther illustration of these
lines in the article <span class='sc'>Water-Line</span>. See also their figure on a ship’s bottom,
plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. fig. 5.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ribbands are likewise of great utility in ship-building; they are
narrow and flexible planks placed on the bottom at different heights, so
as to form a sort of mould for stationing the inferior timbers between
the principal ones. They differ from the water-lines, inasmuch as the
latter have only one curve, which is horizontal, whereas the ribbands,
besides their horizontal one, have a vertical curve. To convey a just
idea of these curves, which cannot be represented on one draught at
their full length, without an oblique section of the ship’s length, it will
be necessary to have recourse to two planes; that of the elevation, which
exhibits their vertical curve; and to the floor-plane, upon which the horizontal
curve is expressed. See <span class='sc'>Ribbands</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>These different lines are extremely useful in exhibiting the various
curves of a ship’s bottom, that as they are gradually diminished, their
uniformity or irregularity may be discovered by the skilful artist.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have already observed, that the qualities required in a ship ought
to determine the figure of the bottom: a ship of war therefore should
be able to sail swiftly, and carry her lower tier of guns sufficiently out
of the water. A merchant-ship ought to contain a large cargo of merchant-goods,
and be navigated with few hands; and both should be
able to carry sail firmly; steer well; drive little to leeward; and sustain
the shocks of the sea without being violently strained.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first thing to be established in the draught of a ship is her length;
and as a ship of war, according to her rate, is furnished with a certain
number of cannon, which are placed in battery on her decks, it is necessary
that a sufficient distance should be left between their ports to
work the guns with facility, and particularly to leave space enough between
the foremost gun and the stem, and between the aftmost gun and
the stern-post on each side, on account of the arching, or inward curve
of the ship towards her extremities.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the length of a ship is determined, it is usual to fix her breadth
by the dimensions of the midship-beam. On this occasion the shipwrights,
for the most part, are conducted by rules founded on their
own observation; for having remarked, that some vessels which by repeated
experience have been found to answer all the purposes of navigation,
have a certain breadth in proportion to their length, they have
inferred that it would be improper to depart from this proportion: but
as other ships have been constructed with different breadths, which were
equally perfect, a variety of different general rules have been adopted
by these artists, who are accordingly divided in their opinions about
the breadth which ought to be assigned to a ship relatively with her
length, whilst each one produces reasons and experience in support of
his own standard. Those who would diminish the breadth alledge, that
a narrow vessel meets with less resistance in passing through the water;
2dly. That by increasing the length she will drive less to leeward; 3dly.
That according to this principle, the water-lines will be more conveniently
formed to divide the fluid; 4thly. That a long and narrow
ship will require less sail to advance swiftly; that her masts will be
lower, and her rigging lighter; and, by consequence, the seamen less
fatigued with managing the sails, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those, on the contrary, who would enlarge the breadth, pretend,
1st. That this form is better fitted to preserve a good battery of guns.
2dly. That there will be more room to work the guns conveniently.
3dly. That by carrying more sail the ship will be enabled to run faster;
or, that this quality will at least overbalance the advantage which the
others have of more easily dividing the fluid. 4thly. That, being broader
at the load-water-line, or place where the surface of the water describes
a line round the bottom, they will admit of being very narrow on the
floor, particularly towards the extremities: and 5thly. That a broad
vessel will more readily rise upon the waves than a narrow one.</p>

<p class='c008'>From such opposite principles has resulted that variety of standards
adopted by different shipwrights; and a servile imitation of these mechanical
methods has, to the great reproach of the art, produced all
these pretended rules of proportion: for the various models they have
hitherto adopted indisputably prove their doubt and uncertainty with
regard to their proper standard. Hence these pretended mysteries which
are only to be revealed to such as are initiated into the craft! Hence
this division of the art into classes, or, according to the technical term,
into <i>families</i>, each of which affects, with becoming solemnity, to be possessed
of the true secret, in preference to all the others! And hence
violence of opposition, and mutual contempt amongst the artists! Indeed
nothing appears more effectually to have retarded the progress of
naval architecture, than the involving it in mysteries which the professors
would gravely insinuate are only intelligible to themselves. This
ridiculous affectation is nevertheless tenaciously retained, notwithstanding
the example to the contrary of some of the most able shipwrights in
Europe, who are real masters of the theory of their art, and do honour
to their profession, and who are justly exempted from the censure to
which the others are often exposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not to be expected that an art so complicated and various, comprehending
such a diversity of structures, can be treated at large in a
work of this sort. To enter into a particular detail of the theory and
practice; to explain the different parts with sufficient accuracy and perspicuity,
would of itself require a large volume, and, by consequence,
greatly exceed the limits of our design. Being thus necessitated to contract
our description into a narrow compass, it will be sufficient to give
a general idea of the subject; to describe the principal pieces of which a
ship is composed, and to explain the principal draughts used in the construction
thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the several lines exhibited in the planes of elevation, projection, &amp;c.
will be rendered more intelligible by a previous account of those pieces,
it may not be improper to begin with reciting their names, and giving
a summary description of their uses and stations. They are for the most
part represented according to the order of their disposition in that part
of plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. which is termed <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span>.</p>

sides to their proper distance.</p>

be at some distance from that of the latter.</p>

a frame that reaches from the keel to the top of the side.</p>

<p class='c008'>X.  The pieces which compose the kelson: they are scarfed together
like the keel pieces, and placed over the middle of the floor-timbers,
upon each of which they are scored about an inch and a half, as exhibited
by the notches.</p>

<p class='c008'>Y.  The several pieces of the knee of the head; the lower part of
which is fayed to the stem; the heel being scarfed to the fore-foot.</p>

the quarter gallery.</p>

<p class='c008'>e e. Two pieces of dead wood, one afore, and another abaft, fayed
on the keel.</p>

<p class='c008'>In vessels of war, the general dimensions are established by authority
of officers appointed by the government to superintend the building of
ships. In the merchants service, the extreme breadth, length of the
keel, depth in the hold, height between-decks and in the waste, are
agreed on by contract; and from these dimensions the shipwright is to
form a draught suitable to the trade for which the ship is designed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In projecting the draught of a vessel of war, the first article to be considered
is her length. As all ships are much longer above than below,
it is also necessary to distinguish the precise part of her height from
which her length is taken: this is usually the lower gun-deck, or the
load water-line. It has been already observed, that water-lines are
described longitudinally on a ship’s bottom by the surface of the water
in which she floats, and that the line which determines her depth under
the water is usually termed the load-water-line. In this draught it
will be particularly necessary to leave sufficient distance between the
ports.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next object is to establish the breadth by the midship-beam. Although
there is great difference of opinion about proportioning the
breadth to the length, yet it is most usual to conform to the dimensions
of ships of the same rate. After the dimensions of the breadth and
length are determined, the depth of the hold must be fixed, which is
generally half the breadth: but the form of the body should be considered
on this occasion; for a flat floor will require less depth in the
hold than a sharp one. The distance between the decks must also be
settled.</p>

<p class='c008'>We may then proceed to fix the length of the keel, by which we shall
be enabled to judge of the rake of the stem and stern-post. The rake is
known to be the projection of the ship at the height of the stem and
stern-post, beyond the ends of the keel afore and abaft; or the angle by
which the length is increased as the fabric rises. To these we may also
add the height of the stem and wing transom.</p>

<p class='c008'>After these dimensions are settled, the timbers may be considered
which form the sides of the ship. A frame of timbers, which appears to
be one continued piece, is composed of one floor-timber, U, whose arms
branch outward to both sides of the ship; (See plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i>
<span class='sc'>Hull</span>) two or three futtocks V V, and a top-timber, W. The futtocks
are connected to the upper arms of the floor-timbers on each side
of the ship, and serve to prolong the timber in a vertical direction: and
the top-timbers are placed at the upper part of the futtocks for the same
purpose. All these being united, and secured by cross-bars, form a circular
enclosure, which is called a frame of timbers, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couple d’un vaisseau</span></i>.
And as a ship is much broader at the middle than at the extremities,
the arms of the floor-timber will form a very obtuse angle at the extreme
breadth; but this angle decreases in proportion to the distance of
the timbers from the midship-frame, so that the foremost and aftmost
ones will form a very acute angle. Floor-timbers of the latter sort are
usually called crutches.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shipwrights differ extremely in determining the station of the midship-frame;
some placing it at the middle of the ship’s length, and others
further forward. They who place it before the middle, alledge, that if
a ship is full forward, she will meet with no resistance after she has
opened a column of water; and that the water so displaced will easily
unite abaft, and by that means force the ship forward; besides having
more power on the rudder, in proportion to its distance from the center
of gravity: this also comes nearer the form of fishes, which should
seem the most advantageous for dividing the fluid.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the rising of the midship-floor-timber is decided, we may then
proceed to describe the rising-line of the floor, on the stern-post abaft,
and on the stem afore.</p>

<p class='c008'>The height of the lower-deck is the next thing to be considered: it is
determined in the middle by the depth of the hold; and some builders
make it no higher than the stem; but they raise it abaft as much above
its height in the middle, as the load-water-mark, or draught of water
abaft, exceeds that afore. With regard to the height between decks,
it is altogether arbitrary, and must be determined by the rate of the ship,
and the service she is designed for.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is also necessary to remember the sheer of the wales, and to give
them a proper <i>hanging</i>; because the beauty and stateliness of a ship greatly
depend upon their figure and curve, which, if properly drawn, will,
make her appear airy and graceful on the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>We come now to consider the upper-works, and all that is above
water, called the dead-work: and here the ship must be narrower, so
that all the weight lying above the load-water-line will thereby be
brought nearer the middle of the breadth, and of course the ship will
be less strained by the working of her guns, &amp;c. But although some
advantages are acquired by diminishing the breadth above water, we
must be careful not to narrow her too much; as there must be sufficient
room left on the upper-deck for the guns to recoil. The security of the
masts should likewise be remembered, which requires sufficient breadth
to spread the shrouds. A deficiency of this sort may indeed be in some
measure supplied by enlarging the breadth of the channels.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the qualities required in the construction of a ship, to
fit her for the various purposes of navigation, the reader is referred to
the article <span class='sc'>Bottom</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall now proceed to explain the sheer draught, or plane of <i>elevation</i>,
of a sixty gun ship; wherein we have been attentive to make the
same letters refer to the same objects, as in the explanation of the
<span class='sc'>Pieces</span>, as above; at least when the same objects are in both figures; a
conduct we shall invariably pursue throughout this work, although it
seems to have been forgot by our predecessors. Thus in all the plates of
ship-building, the keel, whether separate or joined, is represented by A,
the stern-post by B, the stem by C, the beams by D; unless where those
objects do not <i>all</i> appear, and then something else is placed instead
thereof. Thus in plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. of the deck, where the keel cannot be seen,
the main hatchway is represented by A, as not being inserted in any
figure wherein the keel appears.</p>

<p class='c008'>A A. The keel, whose upper edge is prolonged by the dotted line p q,

i. e. before the midship frame.</p>

<p class='c008'>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The timbers in the after-body, or which are
erected abaft the midship-frame.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the eye of a spectator is supposed in this projection to view the
ship’s side in a line perpendicular to the plane of elevation, it is evident
that the convexity will vanish, like that of a cylinder or globe, when
viewed at a considerable distance; and that the frames will consequently
be represented by strait lines, except the fashion-piece abaft and the
knuckle-timber forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been already observed, that the plane of projection may be defined
a vertical delineation of the curves of the timbers upon the plane
of the midship-frame, which is perpendicular to that of the elevation.
It is necessary to observe here, that the various methods by which these
curves are described, are equally mechanical and arbitrary. In the latter
sense, they are calculated to make a ship fuller or narrower according
to the service for which she is designed, and in the former they are
drawn according to those rules which the artist has been implicitly
taught, to follow, or which his fancy or judgment has esteemed the
most accurate and convenient. They are generally composed of several
arches of a circle, reconciled together by moulds framed for that purpose.
The radii of those arches therefore are of different lengths, according
to the breadth of the ship in the place where such arches are swept;
and they are expressed on the plane of projection either by horizontal or
perpendicular lines; the radii of the breadth sweeps being always in the
former, and the radii of the floor sweeps in the latter direction. These
two arches are joined by a third, which coincides with both, without
intersecting either. The curve of the top-timber is either formed by a
mould which corresponds to the arch of the breadth-sweep, or by another
sweep, whose center and radius are without the plane of projection.
The breadth of the ship at every top-timber is limited by an horizontal
line drawn on the floor-plane, called the half-breadth of the top-timbers.
The extreme breadth is also determined by another horizontal
line on the floor-plane; and the lines of half-breadth are thus mutually
transferable, from the projection and floor-planes, to each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>The necessary data by which the curves of the timbers are delineated
then are, the perpendicular height from the keel, the main or principal
breadth, and the top-timber breadth: for as a ship is much broader
near the middle of her length than towards the ends, so she is broader
in the middle of her height than above and below; and this latter difference
of breadth is continued throughout every point of her length.
The main breadth of each frame of timbers is therefore the ship’s breadth
nearly in the middle of her height in that part: and the top-timber breadth
is the line of her breadth near the upper ends of each timber. It has been
already observed, that as both sides of a ship are alike, the artificers only
draw one side, from which both sides of the ship are built: therefore
the timbers abaft the midship frame are exhibited on one side of the
plane of projection, and the timbers before it on the other.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>Thus we have endeavoured briefly to explain the nature and uses of
the principal draughts used in the construction of a ship, which reciprocally
correspond with each other in the dimensions of length, breadth,
and depth. Thus the plane of elevation is exactly of the same length
with the horizontal or floor-plane. The several breadths of the timbers
in the floor-plane and that of the projection are mutually transferable;
and the real height of the timbers in the projection, exactly conforms to
their height in the elevation. Thus let it be required to transfer the
height of the wing-transom from the elevation to the projection:</p>

<p class='c008'>Extend the compasses from the point K, in the elevation, down to
the dotted line prolonged from the upper-edge of the keel, and setting
the other foot in the point <i>p</i>, then shall the line K <i>p</i> be the perpendicular
height of the wing transom: transfer this from the middle of the line
B A C, in the projection, to the point K in the perpendicular A F, then
will A K be the height of the wing-transom in the plane of projection:
and thus the height of all the transoms may be laid from the former
upon the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, let it be required to transfer the main-breadth of the midship-frame
from the projection to the horizontal plane: Set one foot of the
compasses in the point ⊕ on the perpendicular C E, and extend the
other along the main-breadth-sweep ⊕ G, till it touches the perpendicular
A F parallel to C E: lay this distance upon the horizontal plane
from the point u in the line of the ship’s length, B A C, along the plane
of the midship-frame to the point ⊕; so shall the line ⊕ W U be the
breadth of the midship-frame on the horizontal plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus also the top-timber-breadth, or the distance of each top-timber
from the middle of the ship’s breadth, may be in the same manner transferred,
by extending the compasses from the line B A C, in the horizontal
plane, to the top-timber breadth-line, upon any particular timber,
as 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. which will give its proper dimensions thereon.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same manner the breadths of all the timbers may be laid from
the projection to the horizontal plane, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></i>, from that to the
projection. Thus the height of each timber may also be transferred from
the elevation to the projection, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal utility of these draughts therefore is to exhibit the various
curves of the ship’s body, and of the pieces of which it is framed,
in different points of view, which are either transverse or longitudinal,
and will accordingly present them in very different directions. Thus
the horizontal curves of the transoms and water-lines are represented
on the floor-plane, all of which are nearly streight lines in the elevation
and projection; and thus the vertical curves of the timbers are all exhibited
on the projection, although they appear as streight lines in the
elevation and floor plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before this article is closed, it may be necessary to remark, that the
various pieces represented in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. as well as the lines in the draughts
which have not been already defined, are copiously explained in their
proper places; as it would have been contrary to the plan of this work
to have given a more enlarged description of them here.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the reader, however, might be better enabled to comprehend
the scope of this article, it was judged necessary to give a general sketch
of naval architecture itself; to collect into one point of view the most
material draughts by which a ship is constructed, and to describe, as
concisely as possible, the several parts of which they are composed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal parts of a ship also, which are here reduced into a narrow
compass, will be represented at large in different places of this
work, to illustrate those explanations whither it may be necessary to
refer, in order to understand the subject more clearly. Thus the stern, the
quarter, the midship-frame, the bow and head, of a ship of 74 guns, are
exhibited on a scale of ¼ of an inch to a foot; by which all the subordinate
parts may be distinctly viewed, and their combination and arrangement
sufficiently understood.</p>

<p class='c008'>ARMED-SHIP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vaisseau armé en guerre</span></i>, a vessel occasionally taken into
the service of the government in time of war, and employed to guard
some particular coast, or attend on a fleet. She is therefore armed and
equipped in all respects like a ship of war, and commanded by an officer
of the navy, who has the rank of master and commander. All ships of
this sort are upon the establishment of the king’s sloops, having a lieutenant,
master, purser, surgeon, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>ASHORE, (from <i>a</i> and <i>shore</i>) on the shore, or land, as opposed to
aboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship is said to be <span class='sc'>Ashore</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">echoué</span></i>, when she has run upon the ground,
or on the sea-coast, either by design or accident.</p>

<p class='c008'>ASTERN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au derriere</span></i>, (from <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">a</span></i> and <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">steorn</span></i>, Sax.) any distance behind
a ship, as opposed to <i>a-head</i>, which is before her. Thus, when south
is <i>a-head</i>, or on the line to which the stem is directed, north will be
<i>astern</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>ATHWART, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par le travers</span></i>, (from <i><span lang="da" xml:lang="da">a</span></i> and <i><span lang="da" xml:lang="da">twert</span></i>, Dan. transverse)
when used in navigation, implies across the line of the course; as, we
discovered a fleet at day-break standing <i>athwart</i> us, i. e. steering across
our way.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Athwart-Hause</span>, the situation of a ship when she is driven by the
wind, tide, or other accident, across the fore-part of another. This
phrase is equally applied when the ships bear against each other, or
when they are at a small distance; the transverse position of the former
to the latter being principally understood.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Athwart</span> <i>the fore-foot</i>, a phrase employed to denote the flight of a
cannon-ball, as fired from one ship across the line of another’s course,
to intercept the latter, and compel her to shorten sail till the former
approaches near enough to examine her. The <i>fore-foot</i> is the lower part
of the stem; so that the shot flying across it is said to be fired <i>athwart
the fore-foot</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Athwart-Ships</span>, reaching across the ship, from one side to the
other.</p>

<p class='c008'>ATRIP (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trepor</span></i>, Fr. <i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">trippen</span></i>, Dutch) is applied differently to the anchor
and the sails. The anchor is <i>atrip</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">derangée</span></i>, when it is drawn
out of the ground in a perpendicular direction, either by the cable or
buoy-rope. The top-sails are said to be <i>atrip</i>, when they are hoisted up
to the mast-head, or to their utmost extent.</p>

<p class='c008'>AVERAGE, in commerce <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avarie</span></i>, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">averagium</span></i>, Lat.) the accidents and
misfortunes which happen to ships and their cargoes, from the time of
their loading and sailing, till their return and unlading. It is divided
into three kinds. 1. The simple or particular <i>average</i>, which consists in
the extraordinary expences incurred for the ship alone, or for the merchandise
alone; such is the loss of anchors, masts, and rigging, occasioned
by the common accidents at sea; the damages which happen
to merchandises by storms, capture, shipwreck, wet, or rotting; all
which must be borne and paid by the thing that suffered the damage.
2.  The large and common average, being those expences incurred, and
damages sustained, for the common good and security, both of the merchandise
and vessels, consequently to be borne by the ship and cargo,
and to be regulated upon the whole. Of this number are the goods or
money given for the ransom of the ship and cargo; things thrown overboard
for the safety of the ship; the expences of unlading, or entering
into a river or harbour, and the provisions and hire of the sailors when
the ship is put under embargo. 3. The small averages, which are expences
for towing and piloting the ship out of, or into harbours, creeks,
or rivers; one third of which must be charged to the ship, and two
thirds to the cargo.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Average</span> is more particularly used for a certain contribution that
merchants make proportionably towards their losses. It also signifies a
small duty which the merchants, who send goods in another man’s ship,
pay to the master, for his care of them, over and above the freight. Hence
it is expressed in the bills of lading, paying so much freight for the said
goods, with damage and average accustomed.</p>

<p class='c008'>AWEIGH, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a quitté</span></i> (of <i>a</i> and <i>weigh</i>) the state of the anchor when it is
drawn out of the ground in a perpendicular direction, by the application
of mechanical powers, as a capstern or windlass, to the cable within
the ship; so that aweigh is synonimous to <i>atrip</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>AWNING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tendelet</span></i>, (from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aulne</span></i>, Fr.) a canopy of canvass extending
over the decks of a ship in hot weather, for the convenience of the
officers and crew, and to preserve the decks from being cracked or split,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ebaroui</span></i>, by the heat of the sun: The awning is supported by a range of
light posts, called stanchions, which are erected along the ship’s side on
the right and left; it is also suspended in the middle by a complication
of small cords, called a crowfoot. See the article <span class='sc'>Crowfoot</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>AZIMUTH-<span class='sc'>Compass</span>, an instrument employed to discover the magnetical
azimuth or amplitude of any heavenly object. This operation is
performed at sea, to find the exact variation of the magnetical needle.
The compass will be described in its proper place: it is, however, necessary
here to explain the additional contrivance by which it is fitted to
take the magnetical azimuth, or amplitude of the sun or stars, or the
bearings of head-lands, ships, and other objects at a distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brass edge, originally designed to support the card, and throw
the weight thereof as near the circumference as possible, is itself divided
into degrees and halves; which may be easily estimated into smaller
parts if necessary. The divisions are determined by means of a cat-gut
line stretched perpendicularly with the box, as near the brass edge as
may be, that the parallax arising from a different position of the observer
may be as little as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is also added an index at the top of the inner-box, which may
be fixed on or taken off at pleasure, and serves for all altitudes of the
object. It consists of a bar, equal in length to the diameter of the inner-box,
each end being furnished with a perpendicular stile, with a slit parallel
to the sides thereof; one of the slits is narrow, to which the eye is
applied, and the other is wider, with a small cat-gut stretched up the
middle of it, and from thence continued horizontally from the top of
one stile to the top of the other. There is also a line drawn along the
upper surface of the bar. These four, viz. the narrow slit, the horizontal
cat-gut thread, the perpendicular one, and the line on the bar, are in the
same plane, which disposes itself perpendicularly to the horizon when the
inner-box is at rest and hangs free. This index does not move round,
but is always placed on, so as to answer the same side of the box.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun’s azimuth is known to be an angle contained between the
meridian and the center of the sun. When this is required, and his rays
are strong enough to cast a shadow, the box is turned about till the
shadow of the horizontal thread, or if the sun be too low, till that of
the perpendicular thread, in one stile, or the slit through the other, falls
upon the line in the index bar, or vibrates to an equal distance on each
side of it, the box being gently touched if it vibrates too far: at the
same time they observe the degree marked upon the brass edge of the
cat-gut line. In counting the degree for the azimuth, or any other angle
that is reckoned from the meridian, the outward circle of figures
upon the brass edge is used; and the situation of the index, with respect
to the card and needle, will always direct upon what quarter of the
compass the object is placed.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the sun does not shine out sufficiently strong, the eye is placed
behind the narrow slit in one of the stiles, and the wooden box turned
about till some part of the horizontal, or perpendicular thread appears
to intersect the center of the sun, or vibrate to an equal distance on each
side of it; smoked glass being used next the eye, if the sun’s light is too
strong. In this method another observer is necessary, to note the degree
cut by the nonius, at the same time the first gives notice that the
thread appears to split the object.</p>

<p class='c008'>Plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 20. is a perspective view of the compass, when in order
for observation; the point of view being the center of the card, and the
distance of the eye two feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>A B. is the wooden box in which it is usually contained.</p>

<p class='c008'>K.  is a cat-gut line drawn from the inside of the box for determining
the degree upon the brass edge.</p>

<p class='c008'>L, M, N, O. is the index bar with its two stiles, and cat-gut threads,
which being taken off from the top of the box, is placed in two pieces
P Q, notched properly to receive it.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>BACK <i>of the post</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Stern-post</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>To <span class='sc'>Back</span> <i>an anchor</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empeneller</span></i>, to carry out a small anchor, as the
stream or kedge, ahead of the large one, by which the ship usually
rides, in order to support it, and prevent it from loosening, or <i>coming
home</i>, in bad ground. In this situation, the latter is confined by the
former, in the same manner that the ship is restrained by the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To <span class='sc'>Back</span> astern</i>, in rowing, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">scier à culer</span></i>, is to manage the oars in a direction
contrary to the usual method, so as that the boat or vessel impressed
by their force, shall retreat, or move with her stern foremost,
instead of advancing.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To <span class='sc'>Back</span> the sails</i>, is to arrange them in a situation that will occasion
the ship to retreat or move astern. This operation is particularly necessary
in narrow channels, when a ship is carried along sideways by the
strength of the tide or current, and it becomes requisite to avoid any
object that may intercept her course, as shoals, or vessels under sail, or at
anchor: it is also necessary in a naval engagement, to bring a ship back,
so as to lie opposite to her adversary, when she is too far advanced in the
line. See <span class='sc'>Aback</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BACK-BOARD, a piece of board of a semicircular figure, placed transversely
in the after-part of a boat, like the back of a chair, and serving
the passengers to recline against whilst sitting in the stern-sheets. See
<span class='sc'>Boat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BACK-STAYS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cale haubans</span></i>, (from <i>back</i> and <i>stay</i>) long ropes reaching
from the topmast-heads to the starboard and larboard sides of the
ship, where they are extended to the channels: they are used to support
the top-masts, and second the efforts of the shrouds, when the mast is
strained by a weight of sail in a fresh wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are usually distinguished into breast-back-stays and after-back-stays;
the intent of the former being to sustain the top-mast when the
force of the wind acts upon the ship sideways, or, according to the sea-phrase,
when the ship sails upon a wind; and the purpose of the latter
is to enable it to carry sail when the wind is further aft.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are also back-stays for the top-gallant-masts, in large ships,
which are fixed in the same manner with those of the top-masts.</p>

<p class='c008'>A pair of back-stays is usually formed of one rope, which is doubled
in the middle, and fastened there so as to form an eye, which passes over
the mast-head, from whence the two ends hang down, and are stretched
to the channels by dead-eyes and laniards. See <span class='sc'>Dead-eyes</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The figure of the back-stays, and their position, is exhibited in the
article <span class='sc'>Rigging</span>, to which the reader is further referred.</p>

<p class='c008'>BADGE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouteille, fausse galerie</span></i>, in ship-building, a sort of ornament,
placed on the outside of small ships, very near the stern, containing
either a window, for the convenience of the cabin, or the representation
of it: it is commonly decorated with marine figures, martial instruments,
or such like emblems. See <span class='sc'>Quarter</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>To BALANCE, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balancer</span></i>, Fr.) to contract a sail into a narrower compass,
in a storm, by retrenching or folding up a part of it at one corner;
this method is used in contradistinction to <i>reefing</i>, which is common to
all the principal sails; whereas balancing is peculiar to few, such as the
mizen of a ship, and the main-sail of those vessels, wherein it is extended
by a boom. See <span class='sc'>Boom</span> and <span class='sc'>Reef</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Balance</span> of the mizen, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fanon</span></i>, is thus performed: the mizen-yard
is lowered a little, then a small portion of the sail is rolled up at
the <i>peek</i>, or upper corner, and fastened to the yard about one fifth inward
from the outer end, or yard-arm, toward the mast. See <span class='sc'>Mizen</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A boom-main-sail is balanced, after all its reefs are taken in, by rolling
up a similar portion of the hindmost, or aftmost lower-corner,
called the <i>clue</i>, and fastening it strongly to the boom, having previously
wrapped a piece of old canvas round the part (which is done in
both cases) to prevent the sail from being fretted by the cord which
fastens it.</p>

<p class='c008'>BALLAST, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lest</span></i>, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">ballaste</span></i>, Dut. <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ballastro</span></i>, Span.) a certain portion of
stone, iron, gravel, or such like materials, deposited in a ship’s hold,
when she has either no cargo, or too little to bring her sufficiently low
in the water. It is used to counter-ballance the effort of the wind upon
the masts, and give the ship a proper stability, that she may be enabled
to carry sail without danger of over-turning.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is often great difference in the proportion of ballast required to
prepare ships of equal burthen for a voyage; the quantity being always
more or less, according to the sharpness or flatness of the ship’s bottom,
which seamen call the <i>floor</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The knowledge of ballasting a ship with propriety, is certainly an
article that deserves the attention of the skilful mariner; for although
it is known that ships in general will not carry a sufficient quantity of
sail, till they are laden so deep that the surface of the water will nearly
glance on the extreme breadth amidships; yet there is more than this
general knowledge required; since, if she has a great weight of heavy
ballast, as lead, iron, &amp;c. in the bottom, it will place the center of
gravity too low in the hold; and although this will enable her to carry
a great sail, she will nevertheless sail very heavily, and run the risk of
being dismasted by her violent rolling.</p>

<p class='c008'>To ballast a ship, therefore, is the art of disposing those materials so that
she may be duly poised, and maintain a proper equilibrium on the
water, so as neither to be too <i>stiff</i>, nor too <i>crank</i>, qualities equally pernicious;
as in the first, although the ship may be fitted to carry a great
sail, yet her velocity will not be proportionably increased; whilst her
masts are more endangered by her sudden jerks and excessive labouring:
and in the last, she will be incapable of carrying sail, without the risk of
oversetting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stiffness in ballasting, is occasioned by disposing a great quantity of
heavy ballast, as lead, iron, &amp;c. in the bottom, which naturally places
the center of gravity very near the keel; and that being the center about
which the vibrations are made, the lower it is placed, the more violent
will be the motion of rolling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crankness, on the other hand, is occasioned by having too little ballast,
or by disposing the ship’s lading so as to raise the center of gravity
too high, which also endangers the mast in carrying sail when it blows
hard: for when the masts lose their perpendicular height, they strain on
the shrouds in the nature of a lever, which encreases as the sine of their
obliquity; and a ship that loses her masts is in great danger of being lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole art of ballasting, therefore, consists in placing the center of
gravity to correspond with the trim and shape of the vessel, so as neither
to be too high nor too low; neither too far forward, nor too far aft; and
to lade the ship so deep, that the surface of the water may nearly rise to
the extreme breadth amidships; and thus she will be enabled to carry a
good sail, incline but little, and ply well to the windward. See the article
<span class='sc'>Trim</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BANIAN-<span class='sc'>Days</span>, a cant term among common sailors, denoting those
days on which they have no flesh-meat: it seems to be derived from the
practice of a nation amongst the eastern Indians, who never eat flesh.</p>

<p class='c008'>BANK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">banc, atterrissement</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">banc</span></i>, Sax.) an elevation of the ground,
or bottom of the sea, which is often so high as to appear above the surface
of the water, or at least so little beneath it, as to prevent a ship
from floating over it: in this sense, bank amounts nearly to the same as
shallows, flats, &amp;c. The shelves that abound with rocks under water,
are distinguished by other names, as reefs, ridges, keys, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>An exact knowledge of the banks, their extent, and the different
depths of water in which they lie, constitutes a very essential portion
of the science of a pilot, or master of a ship. If the vessel be large, and
draws much water, great attention will be necessary to avoid them. If,
on the contrary, she is small, the same banks afford a sure asylum, where
she may brave the largest ships, which dare not follow her to so dangerous
a retreat. Many small vessels have eluded the pursuit of a superior enemy
by means of this hospitable barrier.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Banks</span> on the sea-coast are usually marked by beacons or buoys. In
charts they are distinguished by little dots, as ridges of rocks are characterised
by crosses. The principal banks in the Western Ocean, are those
of Newfoundland, and the Bahama-Bank: the most remarkable one
in Newfoundland is called the Grand Bank, which is of a vast extent,
being nearly two hundred miles in length, and stretching north and
south: its usual depth is from twenty to eighty fathoms: and this is the
great scene of the cod-fishery, which is so material an article in European
commerce.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bank</span> <i>of oars</i>, a seat or bench of rowers in a galley.</p>

<p class='c008'>BANKER, a vessel employed in the cod-fishery on the Banks of Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='c008'>BAR <i>of a port or haven</i>, a shoal or bank of sand, gravel, &amp;c. thrown
up by the surge of the sea, to the mouth of a river or harbour, so as
to endanger, and sometimes totally prevent the navigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>BARCA-LONGA, a large Spanish fishing-boat, navigated with lug-sails,
and having two or three masts: these are very common in the
Mediterranean. See <span class='sc'>Vessel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BARGE (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">bargie</span></i>, Dutch) a vessel or boat of state, furnished with elegant
apartments, canopies, and cushions; equipped with a band of
rowers, and decorated with flags and streamers: they are generally used
for processions on the water, by noblemen, officers of state, or magistrates
of great cities. Of this sort we may naturally suppose the famous
barge or galley of Cleopatra, which, according to Shakespeare,</p>

<p class='c008'>There are likewise other barges of a smaller kind, for the use of admirals
and captains of ships of war. These are of a lighter frame,
and may be easily hoisted into, and out of the ships to which they occasionally
belong. See <span class='sc'>Boat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Barge</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabotiere</span></i>, is also the name of a flat-bottomed vessel of burthen,
for lading and discharging ships, and removing their cargoes from
place to place in a harbour.</p>

<p class='c008'>BARK (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">barca</span></i>, low Lat.) a general name given to small ships: it is
however peculiarly appropriated by seamen to those which carry three
masts without a mizen top-sail. Our northern mariners, who are trained
in the coal-trade, apply this distinction to a broad-sterned ship, which
carries no ornamental figure on the stem or prow.</p>

<p class='c008'>BARNICLE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cravan</span></i>, a species of shell-fish, often found sticking to the

<p class='c008'>BARRICADE (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">barricada</span></i>, Span.) a strong wooden rail, supported by
several little pillars or stanchions, and extending, as a fence, across
the foremost part of the quarter-deck. In a vessel of war, the intervals
between the pillars are commonly filled with cork, junks of old
cable, or matts of platted cordage. In the upper-part, there is a double
rope-netting, supported by double cranes of iron, extending about a foot
above the rail; and between the two parts of the netting are stuffed a
number of hammocks, filled with the seamens bedding, to intercept
and prevent the execution of small-shot fired by swivel guns, carabines,
or muskets, in the time of battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>BARS <i>of the Capstern and Windlass</i>. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>BASIN <i>of a dock</i>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bassin</span></i>, Fr.) a place where the water is confined by double
flood-gates, and thereby prevented from running out at the tide of
ebb. The use of it is to contain ships whilst repairing, either before they
enter, or after they come out of the dock.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Basin</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paradis</span></i>, also implies some part of a haven, which opens from
a narrow channel into a wide and spacious reservoir for shipping.</p>

<p class='c008'>BATTENS <i>of the hatches</i>, a sort of long narrow laths, scantlings of
wooden stuff, or streight hoops of casks. They are nailed along the
edges of tarpaulings, which are pieces of tarred canvas, of sufficient
breadth and length to cover the hatches at sea; the battens serve to
confine the edges of the tarpaulings close down to the sides of the
hatches, to prevent the water, which may rush over the decks in a
storm, from penetrating into the lower apartments of the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>BAY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baye</span></i>, a gulf or inlet of the sea-coast, comprehended between
two promontories, or capes of land, where shipping frequently ride at

<p class='c008'>BEACON, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balise</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">beacon</span></i>, Sax.) a post or stake erected over a shoal
or sand-bank, as a warning to seamen to keep their ships at a distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>BEAK-HEAD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coltis</span></i>, a name given to a ship’s head whose forecastle
is square or oblong, a circumstance common to all vessels of war which
have two or more decks of guns. In smaller ships, the forecastle is
nearly shaped like a parabola, whose vertex, or angular point, lies immediately
over the stem.</p>

<p class='c008'>The strong, projecting, pointed beaks used by the antients in time
of battle, have been intirely rejected since the use of gun-powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>BEAMS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baux</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">beam</span></i>, Sax. a tree) strong thick pieces of timber,
stretching across the ship from side to side, to support the decks, and
retain the sides at their proper distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Beams</span> of ships of war are usually formed of three pieces scarfed
together; as appears in plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. They are sustained at each end by
thick planks in the ship’s side, called clamps, upon which they rest.
They are also firmly connected to the timbers of the ship by means of
strong knees, and sometimes by standards. See <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is necessary that the beams, as represented in the midship-frame,
should have a greater height in the middle than at the two ends, to
carry the water more readily off from the decks, and to diminish the
recoil of the guns, which will thereby more easily return into their
places.</p>

<p class='c008'>The longest of these is called the <i>midship-beam</i>; it is lodged in the
midship-frame, or between the widest frame of timbers. At about two
thirds of the height from the keel to the lower-deck, are laid a range of
beams, to fortify the hold, and support a platform called the orlop,
which contains the cables and stores of the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are usually twenty-four beams on the lower-deck of a ship of
seventy-four guns, and to the other decks additional ones in proportion,
as the ship lengthens above.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>On the</i> <span class='sc'>Beam</span>, implies any distance from the ship on a line with the
beams, or at right angles with the keel: thus, if the ship steers or
points northward, any object lying east or west, is said to be on the
starboard or larboard <i>beam</i>. Thus also,</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Before the</i> <span class='sc'>Beam</span>, is an arch of the horizon comprehended between
the line that crosses her length at right angles, and some object at a
distance before it, or between the line of the beam, and that point of
the compass which she stems. Thus if a ship, steering west, discovers
an island on the right, three points <i>before the beam</i>, the island must bear
N W b N from the ship. See the article <span class='sc'>Bearing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BEAN-COD, a small fishing-vessel, or pilot-boat, common on the sea-coasts
and in the rivers of Portugal. It is extremely sharp forward, having
its stem bent inward above into a great curve: the stem is also plated
on the fore-side with iron, into which a number of bolts are driven,
to fortify it, and resist the stroke of another vessel, which may fall
athwart-hause. It is commonly navigated with a large lateen sail, which
extends over the whole length of the deck, and is accordingly well
fitted to ply to windward.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>BEAR-a-hand!</span> a phrase of the same import with make haste, dispatch,
quick, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>BEARING, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gissement</span></i>, an arch of the horizon intercepted
between the nearest meridian and any distant object, either discovered
by the eye, or resulting from the sinical proportion; as in the
first case, at 4 P. M. Cape Spado, in the isle of Candia, bore S by W. by
the compass.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the second, the longitudes and latitudes of any two places being
given, and consequently the difference of latitude and longitude between
them, the bearing from one to the other is discovered by the following
analogy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As the meridional difference of latitude</div>
      <div class='line'>Is to the difference of longitude:</div>
      <div class='line'>So is radius</div>
      <div class='line'>To the tangent bearing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bearing</span> is also the situation of any distant object, estimated from some
part of the ship according to her position. In this sense, an object so discovered,
must be either ahead, astern, abreast, on the bow, or on the
quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'>These <span class='sc'>Bearings</span>, therefore, which may be called mechanical, are on
the beam, before the beam, abaft the beam, on the bow, on the quarter,
ahead, or astern. If the ship sails with a side-wind, it alters the names
of such bearings in some measure, since a distant object on the beam is
then said to be to leeward, or to windward; on the lee quarter, or bow;
and on the weather quarter or bow.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bearing-up</span>, or <span class='sc'>Bearing</span>-away, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arriver</span></i>, in navigation, the act of
changing the course of a ship, in order to make her run before the
wind, after she had sailed some time with a side-wind, or close-hauled:
it is generally performed to arrive at some port under the lee, or to
avoid some imminent danger occasioned by a violent storm, leak, or
enemy in sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>This phrase, which is absurd enough, seems to have been derived from
the motion of the helm, by which this effect is partly produced; as the
helm is then borne <i>up</i> to the windward, or weather side of the ship.
Otherwise, it is a direct contradiction in terms, to say that a ship <i>bears
up</i>, when she goes before the wind; since the current of the wind, as
well as that of a river, is always understood to determine the situation of
objects or places within its limits. In the first sense we say, up to windward
and down to leeward; as in the latter we say, up or down the
river. This expression, however, although extremely improper, is commonly
adopted in the general instructions of our navy, printed by authority,
instead of bearing down, or bearing away.</p>

<p class='c008'>BEATING, in navigation, the operation of making a progress at sea
against the direction of the wind, in a zig-zag line, or traverse, like that
in which we ascend a steep hill. As this method of sailing will be particularly
explained under the term <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>, the reader is referred to
that article.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> BECALM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">derober</span></i>, (from <i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">calme</span></i>, Dut.) to intercept the current of
the wind, in its passage to a ship, with any contiguous object, as a shore
above her sails, a high sea behind, or some other ship. At this time the
sails remain in a state of rest, and are consequently deprived of their
power to govern the motion of the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>BECKETS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bille</span></i>, imply in general any thing used to confine loose
ropes, tackles, oars, or spars, in a convenient place, where they may
be disposed out of the way till they are wanted. Hence, beckets are
either large hooks, or short pieces of rope, with a knot in one end and
an eye in the other, or formed like a circular wreath; or they are
wooden brackets; and, probably, from a corruption and misapplication
of this last term, arose the word becket, which seems often to be
confounded with bracket.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Put the tacks and sheets in the</i> <span class='sc'>Beckets</span>! the order to hang up the weather
main and fore-sheet, and the lee main and fore-tack, to a little
knot and eye-becket on the foremost main and fore-shrouds, when the
ship is close-hauled, to prevent them from hanging in the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>BED, a flat thick piece of timber, usually formed of the rough staves
of casks, or such like materials, to be lodged under the quarters of
casks containing any liquid, and stowed in a ship’s hold. The use
of the beds is to support the cask, and keep the bilge, or middle-part of
it, from bearing against the ship’s floor, or against the body upon which
it rests, lest the staves should give way and break in the place where they
are weakest: or lie in a wet place, so as to rot in the course of the voyage.

<p class='c008'>BEVELLING, in ship-building, the art of hewing a timber with a
proper and regular curve, according to a mould which is laid on one
side of its surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘In order to hew any piece of timber to its proper bevel, it will be
necessary, first, to make one side fair, and out of winding; a term
used to signify that the side of a timber should be a plane. If this side
be uppermost, and placed horizontally, or upon a level, it is plain, if
the timber is to be hewed square, it may be done by a plummet and
line; but if the timber is not hewed square, the line will not touch
both the upper and lower edge of the piece; or if a square be applied to
it, there will be wood wanting either at the upper or lower side. This
is called within or without a square. When the wood is deficient at
the under-side, it is called under-bevelling; and when it is deficient in
the upper-side, it is called standing-bevelling: and this deficiency will
be more or less according to the depth of the piece; so that before the
proper bevellings of the timbers are found, it will be sometimes very
convenient to assign the breadth of the timbers; nay, in most cases it
will be absolutely necessary, especially afore and abaft: though the
breadth of two timbers, or the timber and room, which includes the
two timbers and the space between them, may be taken without any
sensible error, as far as the square body goes. For as one line represents
the moulding-side of two timbers, the fore-side of the one being supposed

as one intire piece of timber.’ <cite>Murray’s Ship-building.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>BIGHT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balant</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bygan</span></i>, Sax. to bend) the double part of a rope when it
is folded, in contradistinction to the end: as, her anchor hooked the <i>bight</i>
of our cable, i.e. caught any part of it between the ends. The <i>bight</i> of his
cable has swept our anchor; that is, the double part of the cable of another
ship, as she ranged about, has entangled itself under the stock or
fluke of our anchor.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bight</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anse</span></i>, is also a small bay between two points of land.</p>

<p class='c008'>BILANDER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bilandre</span></i>, Fr. a small merchant-ship with two masts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Bilander</span> is particularly distinguished from other vessels of two
masts by the form of her main-sail, which is a sort of trapezia, the yard
thereof being hung obliquely on the mast in the plane of the ship’s length,
and the aftmost or hinder end peeked or raised up to an angle of about
45 degrees, and hanging immediately over the stern; while the fore
end slopes downward, and comes as far forward as the middle of the
ship. To this the sail is bent or fastened; and the two lower corners, the
foremost of which is called the tack, and the aftmost the sheet, are
afterwards secured, the former to a ring-bolt in the middle of the ship’s
length, and the latter to another in the taffarel. The main-sails of larger
ships are hung across the deck instead of along it, being fastened to a yard
which hangs at right angles with the mast and the keel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few vessels, however, are now rigged in this method, which has
probably been found more inconvenient than several others. See <span class='sc'>Ship</span>.
It may not be improper to remark, that this name, as well as brigantine,
has been variously applied in different parts of Europe to vessels of
different sorts.</p>

<p class='c008'>BILGE, (supposed from <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bilik</span></i>, Sax. a storm) that part of the floor of
a ship, on either side of the keel, which approaches nearer to an horizontal
than to a perpendicular direction, and on which the ship would
rest if laid on the ground: or more particularly, those parts of the
bottom which are opposite to the heads of the floor-timbers amidships
on each side of the keel. Hence, when a ship receives a fracture in this
place, she is said to be <i>bilged</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BILL <i>of lading</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">connoissement</span></i>, an acknowledgment signed by the master
of a ship, and given to a merchant, containing an account of the goods
which the former has received from the latter, &amp;c. with a promise
to deliver them at the intended place for a certain sum of money. Each
bill of lading must be treble; one for the merchant who ships the goods,
another to be sent to the person to whom they are consigned, and the
third to remain in the hands of the master of the said ship. It must,
however, be observed, that a bill of lading is only used when the goods
sent on board a ship are but part of the cargo; for when a merchant
loads a vessel entirely on his own account, the deed passed between him
and the master of the ship is called charter-party. See <i>Charter-party</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BINACLE, a wooden case or box, which contains the compasses,
log-glasses, watch-glasses, and lights to shew the compass at night.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this is called <i>bittacle</i> in all the old sea-books, even by mariners, it
appears evidently to be derived from the French term <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitacle</span></i>, (a small
habitation) which is now used for the same purpose by the seamen of
that nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Binacle</span> (plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. fig. 4.) is furnished with three apartments, with
sliding shutters: the two side ones, a b, have always a compass in each, d,
to direct the ship’s way, while the middle division, c, has a lamp or candle,
with a pane of glass on either side to throw a light upon the compass
in the night, whereby the man who steers may observe it in the darkest
weather, as it stands immediately before the helm on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are always two binacles on the deck of a ship of war, one being
designed for the man who steers, and the other for the person who superintends
the steerage, whose office is called <i>conning</i>, or <i>cunning</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BIRTH, or <span class='sc'>Berth</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eviteé</span></i>, the station in which a ship rides at anchor,
either alone or in a fleet; or the distance between the ship and any adjacent
object; comprehending the extent of the space in which she
ranges at the length of her cables; as, <i>she lies in a good birth</i>, i. e. in a
convenient situation, or at a proper distance from the shore and other
vessels; and where there is good anchoring-ground, and shelter from the
violence of the wind and sea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Birth</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appartement</span></i>, also signifies the room or apartment where any particular
number of the officers or ship’s company usually mess and reside.
In a ship of war there is commonly one of these between every two guns.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> BITE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mordre</span></i>, to hold fast in the ground; expressed of the anchor.</p>

<p class='c008'>BITS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bittes</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bitol</span></i>, Sax.) a frame composed of two strong pieces of
timber, fixed perpendicularly in the fore-part of a ship, whereon to
fasten her cables as she rides at anchor. See b b, <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>These pieces being let down through square mortises cut in the decks
above and below, are bolted and fore-locked to the ship’s beams. There
are several bits in a ship, the principal of which are those for the cables:
their upper ends commonly reach about four or five feet above the
lower deck, over which the cable passes. They are supported on the
fore part by strong standards; one arm of which is bolted to the
deck, and the other to the bits: and on the after part is fixed a strong
beam of timber, g, (plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span>) parallel to the deck,
and at right angles with the bits, to which it is bolted and forelocked.
The ends of this beam, which is called the cross-piece, reach about two
or three feet beyond the bits, whose upper-ends are nearly two feet above
the cross-piece. The cable being passed once round about these bits, may
be gradually slackened at pleasure; without which it would be impossible
to prevent it from running out with the utmost rapidity, when the ship
rides a great strain, which is always the case in a storm, or an impetuous
tide. In ships of war there are usually two pair of cable bits,
and when they are both used at once, the cable is said to be double-bitted.
The plan of the bits, with their cross-pieces and standards, are
represented in Plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. where b b are the bits, e their standards, and
g the cross-piece.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Bit</span> <i>the cable</i>, is to put it round the bits, in order to fasten it, or
slacken it gradually, which last is called <i>veering away</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other bits are of a smaller kind, but constructed nearly in the same
manner. They are used to fasten the top-sail-sheets, or the ropes by
which the lower corners of the top-sails are extended.</p>

<p class='c008'>BLACK-STRAKES, a range of planks immediately above the wales
in a ship’s side: they are always covered with a mixture of tar and
lamp-black, forming an agreeable variety with the white bottom beneath,
and the scraped planks of the side, covered with melted turpentine
or varnish of pine, above. All the yards are likewise daubed with
this mixture, which not only preserves them from the heat of the sun
and the weather, but gives them a fine gloss, which makes a good appearance
contrasted with the white varnish on the masts.</p>

<p class='c008'>BLADE. See the article <span class='sc'>Oar</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BLOCK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poulie</span></i>, a machine known in mechanics by the name of pully,
and used for various purposes in a ship, particularly to increase the mechanical
power of the ropes employed in contracting, dilating, or traversing
the sails. The ends of these ropes, being arranged in certain places
upon the deck, may thus be readily found whenever they are wanted.
The blocks, which are for these purposes disposed in various places upon
the masts, yards, and sails, and amongst the rigging, are also of various
sizes, shapes, and powers, according to the effect they are calculated
to produce. They are single, double, or treble, being so denominated
from the number of wheels they contain. There are even some of five,
six, and seven fold, but these are only employed to raise or move some
very weighty bodies, and are not used about the yards or sails. We shall
begin by describing the most simple, and afterwards proceed to those
which are more complicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>A common single block is composed of three parts; the shell, the
sheave, and the pins. The shell, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arcasse</span></i>, approaches nearest to the figure
of a long spheroid, somewhat flatted in the middle. Between the two
flat sides it is hollowed so as to receive a narrow cylindrical wheel called
the sheave, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouet</span></i>, formed of lignum vitæ, or other hard wood; and thro’
the centre of this sheave is bored a round hole, to admit of a pin, which
is driven through two corresponding holes in the middle of the shell,
perpendicular to the hollow space within. The pin thus becomes the
axis of the wheel or sheave, which completes the wooden work of the
machine. Thus formed, it is bound with a sort of rope-ring, which
is closely fitted to a notch passing round the surface of the shell, and
over both ends of the pin: and by this ring, or wreath, which is called
a block-strop, they are suspended upon the masts, shrouds, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The complicated blocks, or those which contain a number of wheels,
either have all the wheels to run upon one axis, (see plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.) or have
their shells so formed that the wheels are one above another. In the
former shape they approach nearest the figure of a cylinder, and in the
latter appear like two or more single blocks joined together endways.</p>

<p class='c008'>In plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. fig. 7. a, represents a single block, and b, c, two double ones,
of different kinds, without strops. Fig. e, f, two double tackle-blocks
iron bound, the lower one, f, being fitted with a swivel, g, a double
iron-bound block with a large hook, h, a snatch-block, i, a top-block,
k, a voyal-block, and l, a clue-garnet-block. See <span class='sc'>Snatch-Block</span>, <span class='sc'>Tackle</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Voyal</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Cat-block (plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 15.) is employed to draw the anchor up
the cat-head. See the article <span class='sc'>Cat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The swivel in the iron-bound block is to turn it, that the several parts
of the rope of which the tackle is composed may not be twisted round
each other, which would greatly diminish the mechanical power.</p>

<p class='c008'>The top-block is used to hoist up or lower down the top-masts, and is
for this purpose hooked in an eye-bolt driven into the cap. See <span class='sc'>Cap</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The clue-garnet blocks are used to draw the clues, or lower-corners
of the <i>courses</i>, up to the yard, and are consequently fastened to the clues
of those sails. See <span class='sc'>Clue-garnet</span>. The use of the shoulder on the lower-end,
is to prevent the strop from being fretted or chafed by the motion
of the sail, as the ship rolls or pitches.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOARD, in navigation, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bordée</span></i>, Fr.) the space comprehended between
any two places where the ship changes her course by tacking; or
the line over which she runs between tack and tack, when she is turning
to windward, or sailing against the direction of the wind. See the articles
<span class='sc'>Beating</span> and <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>She makes a good</i> <span class='sc'>Board</span>, i. e. sails nearly upon a streight line, without
deviating to leeward when she is close-hauled. See <span class='sc'>Close-hauled</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOARDING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abordage</span></i>, an assault made by one ship upon another, by entering
her in battle with a detachment of armed men; either because the
efforts of the artillery and musquetry have proved ineffectual, or because
she may have a greater number of men, and be better equipped for
this attack than the enemy who defends herself against it.</p>

<p class='c008'>This stratagem, however, is chiefly practised by privateers upon merchant-ships,
who are not so well provided with men, and rarely attempted
in the royal navy; the battle being generally decided in men of war by
the vigorous execution of a close cannonade.</p>

<p class='c008'>An officer should maturely consider the danger of boarding a ship of
war before he attempts it; and be well assured that his adversary is
weakly manned: for perhaps he wishes to be boarded, and if so, a great
slaughter will necessarily follow.</p>

<p class='c008'>The swell of the sea ought also to be considered, because it may run so
high as to expose both the ships to the danger of sinking.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is perhaps very little prudence in boarding a ship of equal force;
and when it is attempted, it may be either to windward or to leeward,
according to the comparative force or situation of the ships. If there be
any swell, or sea, it may be more adviseable to lay the enemy aboard on
the lee-side, as the water is there the smoothest; besides, if the boarder
is repulsed in that situation, he may more easily withdraw his men, and
stand off from his adversary. But as the weather-ship can generally fall
to leeward at any time, it is perhaps more eligible to keep to windward,
by which she will be enabled to rake her antagonist, or fire the
broadside into her stern as she crosses it, in passing to leeward, which
will do great execution amongst her men, by scouring the whole length
of the deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boarding may be performed in different places of the ship, according
to the circumstances, preparation and position of both: the assailant
having previously selected a number of men armed with pistols and cutlasses.
A number of powder-flasks, or flasks charged with gun-powder
and fitted with a fuse, are also provided, to be thrown upon the enemy’s
deck immediately before the assault. Besides this, the boarder is
generally furnished with an earthen shell, called a stink-pot, which on
that occasion is suspended from his yard-arms or bow-sprit-end. This
machine is also charged with powder, mixed with other inflammable and
suffocating materials, with a lighted fuse at the aperture. Thus prepared
for the action, and having grappled his adversary, the boarder
displays his signal to begin the assault. The fuses of the stink-pot and
powder-flasks being lighted, they are immediately thrown upon the deck
of the enemy, where they burst and catch fire, producing an intolerable
stench and smoke, and filling the deck with tumult and distraction.
Amidst the confusion occasioned by this infernal apparatus, the detachment
provided rush aboard sword in hand, under cover of the smoke,
on their antagonist, who is in the same predicament with a citadel
stormed by the besiegers, and generally overpowered, unless he is furnished
with extraordinary means of defence, or equipped with close-quarters,
to which he can retreat with some probability of safety. See
the article <span class='sc'>Close-Quarters</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOAT (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bæt</span></i>, Sax. <i><span lang="nl-be" xml:lang="nl-be">boot</span></i>, Belg.) a small open vessel, conducted on the water
by rowing or sailing. The construction, machinery, and even the names
of boats, are very different, according to the various purposes for which
they are calculated, and the services on which they are to be employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus they are occasionally slight or strong; sharp or flat-bottomed;
open or decked; plain or ornamented; as they may be designed for swiftness
or burthen; for deep or shallow water; for sailing in a harbour or
at sea; and for convenience, or pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The largest boat that usually accompanies a ship is the long-boat,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaloupe</span></i>, which is generally furnished with a mast and sails: those which
are fitted for men of war, may be occasionally decked, armed, and equipped,
for cruising short distances against merchant-ships of the enemy, or
smugglers, or for impressing seamen, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The barges are next in order, which are longer, slighter, and narrower:
they are employed to carry the principal sea-officers, as admirals, and
captains of ships of war, and are very unfit for sea. See the article
<span class='sc'>Barge</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pinnaces exactly resemble barges, only that they are somewhat smaller,
and never row more than eight oars; whereas a barge properly never
rows less than ten. These are for the accommodation of the lieutenants,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cutters of a ship, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bateaux</span></i>, are broader, deeper, and shorter than the
barges and pinnaces; they are fitter for sailing, and are commonly employed
in carrying stores, provisions, passengers, &amp;c. to and from the
ship. In the structure of this sort of boats, the lower-edge of every
plank in the side over-lays the upper-edge of the plank below, which
is called by shipwrights clinch-work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yawls, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canots</span></i>, are something less than cutters, nearly of the same form,
and used for similar services; they are generally rowed with six oars.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above boats more particularly belong to men of war; as merchant-ships
seldom have more than two, viz. a long-boat and yawl:
when they have a third, it is generally calculated for the countries to
which they trade, and varies in its construction accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merchant-ships employed in the Mediterranean find it more convenient
to use a lanch, which is longer, more flat-bottomed, and better adapted
every way to the harbours of that sea than a long-boat. See <span class='sc'>Lanch</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A wherry, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diligence</span></i>, is a light sharp boat, used in a river or harbour
for carrying passengers from place to place.</p>

<p class='c008'>Punts, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flette</span></i>, are a sort of oblong flat-bottomed boats, nearly resembling
floating stages; they are used by shipwrights and caulkers, for
breaming, caulking, or repairing a ship’s bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moses is a very flat broad boat, used by merchant-ships amongst
the Caribbee-islands, to bring hogsheads of sugar off from the sea-beach
to the shipping which are anchored in the roads.</p>

<p class='c008'>A felucca is a strong passage-boat used in the Mediterranean, from
ten to sixteen banks of oars. The natives of Barbary often employ
boats of this sort as cruisers.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the larger sort of boats, see the articles <span class='sc'>Craft</span>, <span class='sc'>Cutter</span>, <span class='sc'>Periagua</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Shallop</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of all the small boats, a Norway yawl seems to be the best calculated
for a high sea, as it will often venture out to a great distance from
the coast of that country, when a stout ship can hardly carry any sail.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Trim the</i> <span class='sc'>Boat</span>! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barque-droit!</span></i> the order to sit in the boat in such a manner
as that she shall float upright in the water, without leaning to either
side.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To bale the</i> <span class='sc'>Boat</span>, is to throw out the water which remains in her bottom
or the well-room.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Moor the</i> <span class='sc'>Boat</span>! the order to fasten a boat with two ropes, so as that
the one shall counter-act the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a representation of some of the principal boats of a ship of war,
see plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. where fig. 1. exhibits the elevation, or side view, of a ten-oared
barge; a a, its keel; b, the stern-post; c, the stem; b c, the water-line,
which separates what is under the surface of the water from
what is above it; e, the row-locks, which contain the oars between
them; f, the top of the stern; g, the back-board; f g, the place where
the cockswain stands or sits while steering the boat; l, the rudder, and
m, the tiller, which is of framed iron.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 2. represents the plan of the same barge, where d is the ‘thwarts,
or seats where the rowers sit to manage their oars; f, i, h, the stern-sheets;
i k, the benches whereon the passengers sit in the stern-sheets:
the rest is explained in fig. 1.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig 3. is a stern view of the same barge, with the projection of all
the timbers in the after-body; and fig. 4, a head view, with the curves
of all the timbers in the fore-body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having thus explained the different views of the barge, the reader
will easily comprehend the several corresponding parts in the other boats;
where fig. 5 is the plan, and fig. 6 the elevation of a twelve-oared cutter
that rows double banked: which, although seldom employed unless in
capital ships, because requiring twelve rowers, is nevertheless a very
excellent boat, both for rowing and sailing. Fig. 7 and 8 are the head
and stern of this boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 9 is the plan of a long-boat, of which fig. 10 is the elevation, 11
the stern-view, and 12 the head-view.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Boat-hook</span>, an iron hook with a sharp point on the hinder part
thereof, to stick into a piece of wood, a ship’s-side, &amp;c. It is stuck upon
a long pole or shaft, (pl. III. fig. 1 n.) by the help of which a person in the
boat may either hook any thing to confine the boat in a particular place,
or push her off by the sharp point attached to the back of the hook.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Boatswain</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Contre-maitre</span></i>, the officer who has the boats, sails, rigging,
colours, anchors, and cables committed to his charge.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the duty of the boatswain particularly to direct whatever relates to
the rigging of a ship, after she is equipped from a royal dock-yard. Thus
he is to observe that the masts are properly supported by their shrouds,
stays, and back-stays, so that each of those ropes may sustain a proportional
effort when the mast is strained by the violence of the wind,
or the agitation of the ship. He ought also to take care that the blocks
and running-ropes are regularly placed, so as to answer the purposes for
which they are intended; and that the sails are properly fitted to their
yards and stays, and well furled or reefed when occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is likewise his office to summon the crew to their duty; to assist with
his mates in the necessary business of the ship; and to relieve the watch
when it expires. He ought frequently to examine the condition of the
masts, sails, and rigging, and remove whatever may be judged unfit for
service, or supply what is deficient: and he is ordered by his instructions
to perform this duty <i>with as little noise as possible</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOB-STAY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous-barbe</span></i>, a rope used to confine the bowsprit of a ship
downward to the stem, or cut-water. It is fixed by thrusting one of
its ends through a hole bored in the fore-part of the cut-water for this
purpose, and then splicing both ends together so as to make it two-fold,
or like the link of a chain: a <i>dead-eye</i> is then seized into it, and a <i>laniard</i>
passing through this and communicating with another dead-eye
upon the bowsprit, is drawn extremely tight by the help of mechanical
powers. See <span class='sc'>Bowsprit</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use of the bob-stay, is to draw down the bowsprit, and keep it
steddy; and to counter-act the force of the stays of the fore-mast, which
draw it upwards. The bowsprit is also fortified by shrouds from the
bows on each side; which are all very necessary, as the foremast and the
upper-part of the main-mast are stayed and greatly supported by the
bowsprit. For this reason, the bob-stay is the first part of a ship’s
rigging which is drawn tight to support the masts. To perform this
task more effectually, it is usual to suspend a boat, anchor, or other
weighty body, at the bowsprit-end, to press it downwards during this
operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOLSTERS, a sort of small cushions or bags, filled with tarred canvas,
laid between the collars of the stays and the edge of some piece of
wood on which they lie: they are used to preserve the stays from being
chafed or galled by the motion of the masts, as the ship rocks or pitches
at sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOLT-ROPE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ralingue</span></i>, a rope to which the edges or skirts of the
sails are sewed, to strengthen, and prevent them from rending. Those
parts of the bolt-rope which are on the perpendicular or sloping edges,
are called leech-ropes; that at the bottom, the foot-rope; and that on
the top or upper edge, the head-rope. Stay-sails, whose heads are
formed like an acute angle, have no head-rope. To different parts of
the bolt-rope are fastened all the ropes employed to contract or dilate
the sails. The figure and position of the bolt-rope is exhibited in the
plate referred to from the article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOMB. See the articles <span class='sc'>Mortar</span> and <span class='sc'>Shell</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOMB-VESSEL, a small ship particularly calculated to throw bombs
into a fortress. They are said to be invented by M. Reyneau, and to
have been first put in action at the bombardment of Algiers. Till then
it had been judged impracticable to bombard a place from the sea. See
a particular description of these ships in the article <span class='sc'>Ketch</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOOM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estacade</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barre</span></i>, (from <i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">boom</span></i>, a tree, Dutch) in marine fortification,
a strong chain or cable, on which are fastened a number of poles,
bars, &amp;c. extending athwart the mouth of a harbour or river, to prevent
the enemies ships of war from entering. It may be occasionally
sunk, or drawn up to the surface of the water, by capsterns, and other
mechanical powers.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Booms</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boute dehors</span></i>, certain long poles run out from different places
in the ship to extend the bottoms of particular sails. Of these there
are several sorts; as the jib-boom, studding-sail-booms, ring-tail-boom,
driver-boom, main-boom, and square-sail-boom; the two last, however,
are only appropriated to small ships of one or two masts. See <span class='sc'>Jib</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOOT-TOPPING, the act of cleaning the upper-part of a ship’s bottom,
or that part which lies immediately under the surface of the water,
and daubing it over with tallow, or with a <i>coat</i> or mixture of tallow,
sulphur, resin, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Boot-topping</span> is chiefly performed where there is no dock, or other
commodious situation for breaming or careening; or when the hurry
of a voyage renders it inconvenient to have the whole bottom properly
trimmed and cleansed of the filth which gathers to it in the course of a
sea-voyage. It is executed by making the ship lean to one side, as much
as they can with safety, and then scraping off the grass, slime, shells, or
other material, that adheres to the bottom, on the other side, which
is elevated above the surface of the water for this purpose, and accordingly
daubed with the coat of tallow and sulphur. Having thus
finished one side, they make the ship lean to the other side, and perform
the same operation, which not only preserves the bottom from the
worm, but makes the ship slide smoothly through the water. See
<span class='sc'>Careen</span> and <span class='sc'>Dock</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOTH SHEETS AFT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre deux écoutes</span></i>, the situation of a ship that
sails right afore the wind, or with the wind right astern.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOTTOM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carene</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">botm</span></i>, Sax. <i><span lang="nl-be" xml:lang="nl-be">bodem</span></i>, Belg.) as a sea-term, is either used
to denote the bottom of a ship, or that of the water: thus in the former
sense we say, a clean or a foul bottom; a British, French, or Dutch bottom:
and in the latter sense, a rocky, sandy, or oozy bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bottom of a ship, as we have described in the article <i>Naval</i>
<span class='sc'>Architecture</span>, comprehends all that part which is under water when
the ship is laden; the figure of it must therefore be determined by the
qualities required in the ship, and the purposes for which the is designed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been remarked, that a ship of war should carry her lowest tier
of cannon sufficiently above the surface of the water to be used when
necessary. If this quality is neglected, a small ship will have the advantage
of a large one, inasmuch as the latter cannot open her lower
battery in a fresh side-wind, without being exposed to extreme danger,
by receiving a great quantity of water in at her ports between-decks.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship should be duly poised, so as not to dive or pitch heavily, but
go smoothly and easily through the water, rising to the waves when
they run high, or when the vessel has reduced her sail to the storm.
If she is deficient in this article, the seas will frequently burst aboard, and
strain the decks or carry away the boats. The masts are also greatly endangered
from the same cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship should sail well when large, or before the wind; but particularly
when <i>close-hauled</i>, or sailing with a side-wind. She should also be
enabled in the latter situation to keep her wind, without deviating much
to leeward; to work and tack easily, and lie in a turbulent sea without
straining violently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of our shipwrights have considered it extremely difficult, if not
impracticable, to make a ship carry her cannon well, bear a competent
sail, and advance swiftly through the water; because a very full bottom is
necessary to acquire the two first qualities; whereas a sharp floor is better
fitted to procure the latter. But when it is remembered, that a full ship
will carry a much greater force of sail than a sharp one, a good artist may
form the body so as to unite all these three qualities with the additional
one of steering easily, by paying a proper attention to the following
general rules.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make a ship carry a good sail. A flat floor-timber somewhat long,
or the lower-futtocks pretty round, a streight upper-futtock, the top-timber
to throw out the breadth aloft; at any rate to carry the main-breadth
as high as the lower-deck. Now if the rigging be well adapted
to such a body, and the upper-works lightened as much as possible, so
that the whole contributes to lower the center of gravity, there will be
no reason to doubt of the ship’s carrying a good sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make a ship steer well, and answer the helm readily. If the fashion-pieces
be well formed, the tuck, or spreading-parts under the stern,
carried pretty high; the midship-frame well forward; a considerable
additional depth in the draught of water abaft more than forward; a
great rake forward and none abaft; a snug quarter-deck and forecastle:
all these will greatly facilitate the steerage; and a ship that sails well
will always steer easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make a ship carry her guns well out of the water. A long floor-timber,
and not of great rising; a very full midship-frame, and low
tuck, with light upper-works.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make a ship go smoothly through the water, and prevent her
from pitching heavily. A long keel, a long floor, not to rise too high
afore and abaft; but the area, or space contained in the fore-body, according
to the respective weight it is destined to carry: all these are
necessary to make a ship pass easily through the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make a ship keep a good wind and drive little to leeward. A
good length by the keel; not too broad, but pretty deep in the hold,
which will occasion her to have a short floor-timber and a very great
rising. As such a ship will meet with great resistance in driving sideways,
and feel very little, in advancing or going ahead, she will fall very little
to leeward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Being thus furnished with the methods to qualify a ship for the different
purposes of navigation, the only difficulty remains to apply them
properly in the construction, which must, in a great measure, be left to
the judgment of the artist. The whole art then is evidently to form
the body in such a manner, as that none of these qualities shall be entirely
destroyed; and in giving the preference to that which is principally
required in the service for which the ship is destined. As it
therefore appears possible to unite them all in one vessel so that each of
them may be easily discerned, a neglect of this circumstance ought to be
attributed to the incapacity of the shipwright, who has not studied
the principles of his art with proper application. See <i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>,
<span class='sc'>Building</span>, and <span class='sc'>Ship</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOTTOMRY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bomerie</span></i>, (from <i>bottom</i>) a contract for borrowing money
on the keel or bottom of a ship; so that the commander binds the ship
herself, that if the money be not paid at the time appointed, the creditors
shall have the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bottomry</span> is also where a person lends money to a merchant or adventurer
who wants it in traffic, and the lender is to be paid a much
greater sum at the return of the ship, standing to the hazard of the
voyage. Although the interest on this account be greater than the law
commonly allows, it is yet not esteemed usury; because the money being
supplied at the lenders risk, if the ship perishes, he shares in the
loss thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOW, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">epaule</span></i>, in ship-building, the rounding part of a ship’s side forward,
beginning at the place where the planks arch inwards, and terminated
where they close at the stem or prow. See the article Head,
where the bow of a ship is represented at large. It is proved by a variety
of experiments, that a ship with a narrow bow is much better calculated
for sailing swiftly, than one with a broad bow; but is not so well fitted
for a high sea, into which she always <i>pitches</i>, or plunges, her fore-part
very deep, for want of sufficient breadth to repel the volume of water,
which she so easily divides in her fall. The former of these is called by
seamen a <i>lean</i>, and the latter a <i>bluff</i> bow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The bow which meets with the least resistance in a direct course,
not only meets with the least resistance in oblique courses, but also has
the additional property of driving the least to leeward; which is a
double advantage gained by forming the bow so as to give it that
figure which will be the least opposed in moving through any medium.”
<cite>Bouguer’s Traité du Navire.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'><i>On the</i> <span class='sc'>Bow</span>, in navigation, an arch of the horizon, comprehended
between some distant object, and that point of the compass which is
right-ahead, or to which the ship’s stem is directed. This phrase is
equally applicable, when the object is beheld from the ship, or discovered
by trigonometrical calculation: as, we saw a fleet at day-break bearing
three points <i>on the starboard bow</i>; that is, three points, from that part of
the horizon which is right ahead, towards the right hand. See also
the article <span class='sc'>Bearing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOWER. See the article <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOWLINE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouline</span></i>, a rope fastened near the middle of the leech, or
perpendicular edge of the square sails, by three or four subordinate parts,
called bridles. It is only used when the wind is so unfavourable that
the sails must be all braced sideways, or <i>close-hauled</i> to the wind: in this
situation the bowlines are employed to keep the weather, or windward,
edges of the principal sails tight forward and steddy, without which
they would be always shivering, and rendered incapable of service. See
the articles <span class='sc'>Bridle</span>, <span class='sc'>Close-hauling</span>, and <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To check the</i> <span class='sc'>Bowline</span>, is to slacken it, when the wind becomes large.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='fss'>BOWSE</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">palanquer</span></i>, to draw on any body with a tackle, or complication
of pullies, in order to remove it, or otherwise alter its state or
situation: this is chiefly practised when such alteration or removal cannot
be conveniently effected without the application of mechanical
powers. This term is pronounced <i>bowce</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOWSPRIT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaupré</span></i>, (from <i>bow</i> and <i>sprit</i>) a large boom or mast,
which projects over the stem, to carry sail forward, in order to govern
the fore part of a ship, and counter-act the force of the sails extended
behind, or, in the <i>after</i> part. It is otherways of great use, as being the
principal support of the fore-mast, by confining the <i>stays</i> whereby it is
secured, and enabled to carry sail: these are great ropes stretching from
the mast-head to the middle of the bowsprit, where they are drawn
tight. See the articles <span class='sc'>Stay</span> and <span class='sc'>Dead-eye</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOXES <i>of the pump</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Pump</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOX-HAULING, in navigation, a particular method of veering a
ship, when the swell of the sea renders tacking impracticable. It is performed
by putting the helm <i>a-lee</i>, to throw the head up to windward,
where meeting with great resistance from the repeated shocks of the
waves on the weather bow, it <i>falls off</i>, or turns to leeward, with a quicker
effort, and without advancing. The aftermost sails are at this time diminished,
or perhaps altogether deprived of their force of action, for a
short time, because they would otherwise counteract the sails forward,
and prevent the ship from turning. They are, however, extended as
soon as the ship, in veering, brings the wind on the opposite quarter,
as their effort then contributes to assist her motion of wheeling.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Box-hauling</span> is generally performed when the ship is too near the
shore to have room for veering in the usual way. See <span class='sc'>Veering</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BOXING, an operation in sailing somewhat similar to box-hauling.
It is performed by laying the head-sails, or the sails in the fore-part of
the ship, aback, to receive the greatest force of the wind in a line perpendicular
to their surfaces, in order to throw the ship’s head back
into the line of her course, after she had inclined to windward of it by
neglect of the helmsman, or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>BRACE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bras</span></i>, a rope employed to wheel, or traverse the sails upon
the mast, in a direction parallel to the horizon, when it is necessary to
shift the sails that they may correspond with the direction of the wind
and the course of the ship. Braces are, for this purpose, fastened to the
extremities of the yards, which are called the <i>yard-arms</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the braces of the yards are double, except those of the top-gallant,
and spritsail-topsail yards. The mizen-yard is furnished with <i>fangs</i>,
or vangs, in the room of braces. See the article <span class='sc'>Mizen</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BRACKETS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">consoles</span></i>, short crooked timbers resembling knees. They
are fixed under the galleries and frame of a ship’s head, to support the
gratings.</p>

<p class='c008'>BRAILS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cargues</span></i>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">breuils</span></i>, Fr.) certain ropes passing through pullies on
the mizen-mast, and afterwards fastened, in different places, on the hinder,
or aftmost ridge of the sail, in order to truss it up to the mast, as
occasion requires. See <span class='sc'>Mizen</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Brails</span>, is likewise a general name given to all the ropes which are
employed to <i>haul up</i>, or collect to their yards, the bottoms, lower corners,
and skirts of the other great sails, for the more ready <i>furling</i> them
whenever it is necessary. The operation of thus drawing them together,
is called brailing them up, or hauling them up in the brails. See the article
<span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BRAKE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brimbale</span></i>, the handle, or lever, by which a common ship-pump
is usually managed. It operates by means of two iron bolts
thrust through the inner end of it; one of which resting across two
cheeks or ears, in the upper-end of the pump, serves as a fulcrum for
the brake, supporting it between the cheeks. The other bolt connects
the extremity of the brake to the pump-spear, which draws up the <i>box</i>
or piston, charged with the water in the tube. See the article <span class='sc'>Pump</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREADTH, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">largeur</span></i>, the measure of a ship from side to side in any
particular place: it is usually distinguished into extreme-breadth, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ligne
du fort</span></i>, main-breadth, and top-timber-breadth. See the explanation
of the plane of projection, in the article <i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the sides of the ship are formed by a variety of ribs, called timbers,
and the areas of those timbers being of different breadths above and below,
it is necessary to distinguish them in the construction, in order to form
their several curves, and fix the corresponding pieces with more accuracy
and precision. The part of every timber which encloses the greatest
space from the middle-line of the ship’s length, is therefore called the
<i>main</i>-breadth; and the distance between the upper-part of the same timber
and the middle-line of the ship’s length, is called the top-timber-breadth.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the ship is also broader at the midship-frame than in any other
point of her length, the distance between her sides in the main-breadth
of that timber, is called the extreme-breadth of the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Breadth-sweep</span>, the radius of the arch which forms part of the
curve of a ship’s timber; as explained in the horizontal plane. See <i>Naval</i>
<span class='sc'>Architecture</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREAKERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brisans</span></i>, a name given by sailors to those billows that
break violently over rocks lying under the surface of the sea. They are
distinguished both by their appearance and sound, as they cover that
part of the sea with a perpetual foam, and produce a hoarse and terrible
roaring, very different from what the waves usually have in a deeper
bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship is unhappily driven amongst breakers, it is hardly possible
to save her, as every billow that heaves her upwards, serves to dash
her down with additional force, when it breaks over the rocks or
sands beneath it.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREAKING-BULK, the act of beginning to unlade a ship; or of discharging
the first part of the cargo.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> BREAK-UP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déchirer</span></i>, to rip off the planks of a ship, and take her
to pieces, when she becomes old and unserviceable.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREAK-WATER, the hulk, or hull, of some old ship or vessel, sunk
at the entrance of a small harbour, to break off, and diminish the force
of the waves, as they advance towards the vessels moored within.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Break-water</span> is also a sort of small buoy, fastened to a large one in
the water, when the buoy-rope of the latter is not long enough to reach
from the anchor, lying on the bottom, to the surface of the water. The
use of this break-water is therefore to shew where the buoy swims. See
<span class='sc'>Buoy</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> BREAM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauffer</span></i> (from <i>broom</i>) to burn off the filth, such as grass,
ooze, shells, or sea-weed, from a ship’s bottom, that has gathered to it
in a voyage, or by lying long in a harbour. This operation is performed
by holding kindled furze, faggots, or such materials, to the bottom,
so that the flame incorporating with the pitch, sulphur, &amp;c. that had
formerly covered it, immediately loosens and throws off whatever
filth may have adhered to the planks. After this, the bottom is
covered anew with a composition of sulphur, tallow, &amp;c. which not
only makes it smooth and slippery, so as to divide the fluid more readily,
but also poisons and destroys those worms which eat through the
planks in the course of a voyage. Breaming may be performed either
when the ship lies aground after the tide has ebbed from her, by <i>docking</i>,
or by <i>careening</i>, which see; as also <span class='sc'>Coat</span> and <span class='sc'>Stuff</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREAST-FAST, a sort of hawser, or large rope, employed to confine
a ship sideways to a wharf or key, or to some other ship; as the head-fast
confines her forward, and the stern-fast, abaft.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREAST-HOOKS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guirlandes</span></i>, (from <i>breast</i> and <i>hook</i>) are thick pieces
of timber, incurvated into the form of knees, and used to strengthen
the fore-part of the ship, where they are placed at different heights directly
across the stem, so as to unite it with the bows on each side.</p>

<p class='c008'>The breast-hooks are strongly connected to the stem and hawse-pieces
by tree-nails, and by bolts, driven from without, through the planks and
hawse-pieces, and the whole thickness of the breast-hooks, upon whose
inside those bolts are forelocked, or clinched, upon rings. They are
usually about one third thicker, and twice as long, as the knees of the
decks which they support.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are generally four or five of these pieces in the hold between
the kelson and the lower-deck, in the form of R, (plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i>
<span class='sc'>Hull</span>), upon the uppermost of which the planks of that deck are rabitted.
There are two placed between the lower and the second decks,
in the form of S, (plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.), one of which is immediately beneath the
hawse-holes, and the other under the second deck, whose planks are
inlaid thereon, and upon which the inner-end of the bowsprit frequently
rests.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fore-side of the breast-hook, which is convex, is formed so as to
correspond with the place in which it is stationed, that is to say, it conforms
exactly to the interior figure of that part of the bow where it
ought to be fayed: accordingly the branches, or arms, of the breast-hooks,
make a greater angle as they are more elevated above the keel,
whilst the lower ones are more incurvated, and are almost figured like
the crotches.</p>

<p class='c008'>As it is not necessary that the inner, or concave side of these pieces,
should retain a regular form, the artificers frequently let them remain
as thick as possible, to give additional support to the ship’s fore-part,
where she sustains the whole shock of resistance in dividing the fluid, or
in plunging down into it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is evident that the connexion and solidity of the ship in this place
will be reinforced in proportion to the strength and extent of the breast-hooks,
so that they may cover a greater number of the head-timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREAST-WORK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fronteau</span></i>, a sort of balustrade or fence, composed of
rails or mouldings, and frequently decorated with sculpture. It is used
to terminate the quarter-deck and poop at the fore-ends, and to inclose
the forecastle both before and behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREECHING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brague</span></i>, (from <i>breech</i>) a rope used to secure the cannon
of a ship of war, and prevent them from recoiling too much in the time
of battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is fixed by fastening the middle of it to the hindmost knob or cascabel
of the gun, which sailors call the pomiglion, or pummelion; the
two ends of it are afterwards inserted through two strong rings on the
sides of the carriage, and fastened to other bolts in the ship’s sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>The breeching is of sufficient length to let the muzzle of the cannon
come within the ship’s side to be charged.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use of the breeching, as it checks the recoil of the cannon, is
shewn in plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. <span class='sc'>Deck</span>, where it is expressed by e e, passing through
the ring-bolts, f, on the side of the carriage, g, being fastened to the
cascabel, h. It is also exhibited in the <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>, where it is
employed to lash the cannon when it is <i>housed</i> during the course of a
voyage. See the article <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BREWING, the appearance of a collection of black and tempestuous
clouds arising gradually from a particular part of the hemisphere, as the
fore-runner of a storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>BRIDLES, the upper-part of the moorings laid in the king’s harbours
to ride ships or vessels of war. See the article <span class='sc'>Moorings</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bridles</span> <i>of the bowline</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pattes</span></i>, the legs by which the bowline is fastened
to different places on the edge or skirt of a large sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have already explained the use of the <i>bowline</i>; that it is employed
to confine or keep steddy the windward or weather edges of the principal
sails when they are braced for a side-wind. For as the current of
air enters the cavity of the sail in a direction nearly parallel to its surface,
it follows that the ridge of the sail must necessarily be shaken by
the wind, unless it is kept tight forward; but as a single rope has not
been found sufficient to confine the whole skirt of the sail, inasmuch as it
only draws upon one part thereof, it became necessary to apply bridles
or legs spreading out from the bowline. They are represented in the
figures annexed to the article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BRIG, or <span class='sc'>Brigantine</span>, a merchant-ship with two masts. This term
is not universally confined to vessels of a particular construction, or which
are masted and rigged in a method different from all others. It is variously
applied, by the mariners of different European nations, to a peculiar
sort of vessel of their own marine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst English seamen, this vessel is distinguished by having her
main-sail set nearly in the plane of her keel; whereas the main-sails of
larger ships are hung athwart, or at right angles with the ship’s length,
and fastened to a yard which hangs parallel to the deck: but in a brig,
the foremost edge of the main-sail is fastened in different places to hoops
which encircle the main-mast, and slide up and down it as the sail is
hoisted or lowered: it is extended by a <i>gaff</i> above, and by a boom below.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> BRING <i>by the lee</i>. See <i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Broach-to</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> BRING-TO, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caposer</span></i>, to check the course of a ship
when she is advancing, by arranging the sails in such a manner as that
they shall counter-act each other, and prevent her either from retreating
or moving forward. In this situation the ship is said to lie-by, or lie-to,
having, according to the sea-phrase, some of her sails <i>aback</i>, to oppose
the force of those which are <i>full</i>; or having them otherwise shortened
by being <i>furled</i>, or <i>hauled up in the brails</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bringing-to</span>, is generally used to detain a ship in any particular
station, in order to wait the approach of some other that may be advancing
towards her: or to retard her course occasionally near any
port in the course of a voyage.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Bring-up</span>, a provincial phrase peculiar to the seamen in the coal-trade,
signifying to anchor, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> BROACH-TO, in navigation, to incline suddenly to windward of
the ship’s course when she sails with a large wind; or, when she sails
directly before the wind, to deviate from the line of her course, either
to the right or left, with such rapidity as to bring the ship’s side unexpectedly
to windward, and expose her to the danger of oversetting.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is easy to conceive that a ship will carry much more sail before the
wind than when she makes a progress with her side to its direction;
because when the current of wind acts nearly endways on her hull, the
pressure of it on the masts must be considerably diminished as she
yields to its impulse and flies before it; and that if she carries a
great sail at this time, it can only press her fore-part lower down in the
water. But if, when she carries a great extension of sail, her side is
suddenly brought to the wind, it may be attended with the most fatal
consequences, as the whole force of it then pours like a torrent into
the cavities of the sails. The masts therefore unavoidably yield to this
strong impression, acting like levers on the ship sideways, so as nearly
to overturn her, unless she is relieved by some other event, which may
be also extremely pernicious, such as the sails rending to pieces, or the
masts being carried away.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is generally occasioned by the difficulty of steering the ship; by the
negligence or incapacity of the helmsman; or by some disaster happening
to the helm or its machinery, which renders it incapable of governing
the ship’s course.</p>

<p class='c008'>The difference between broaching-to and bringing <i>by the lee</i>, may be
thus defined. Suppose a ship with a great sail set is steering south, having
the wind N.N.W. then is west the <i>weather</i>, and east the <i>lee-side</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If by some deficiency in the steerage her head turns round to the
westward, so as that her sails are all taken aback on the weather-side
before she can be made to return to the course from which she has deviated,
she is said to <i>broach-to</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If otherwise her head, from the same cause, has declined so far eastward
as to lay her sails aback on that side which was the lee-side, it is
called bringing her by the lee.</p>

<p class='c008'>BROADSIDE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bordee</span></i>, in a naval engagement, the whole discharge of
the artillery on one side of a ship of war above and below; as,</p>

<p class='c008'>We poured a broadside into the enemy’s ship, i. e. discharged all the
ship’s cannon on one side upon her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She brought her broadside to bear on the castle; that is, disposed the
ship so as to point all her cannon to it within point-blank range.</p>

<p class='c008'>A squall of wind laid the ship on her broadside; that is, pressed her
down in the water, so as nearly to overturn her.</p>

<p class='c008'>BROKEN-BACKED, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arcqué</span></i>, the state or quality of a ship, which is
so loosened in her frame, either by age, weakness, or some great strain,
as to droop at each end.</p>

<p class='c008'>This circumstance is more common amongst French than the English
or Dutch ships, owing partly to their great length, and to the sharpness
of the floor, whose breadth is not sufficiently carried from the middle towards
each end; and partly from being frequently obliged to have a
great weight in both ends, when they are empty in the middle, at the
time of discharging one cargo and taking in another. See <span class='sc'>Cambering</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUCCANEER, a name given to certain piratical rovers of various
European nations, who formerly infested the Spanish coasts in America,
and, under pretence of traffic with the inhabitants, frequently seized
their treasure, plundered their houses, and committed many other depredations.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Ship</i>-BUILDING may be defined the manner of constructing ships,
or the work itself, as distinguished from naval architecture, which we
have rather considered as the theory or art of delineating ships on a
plane, and to which this article may properly be understood as a supplement.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pieces by which this complicated machine is framed, are joined
together in various places, by scarfing, rabitting, tenanting, and scoring.
See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the construction of a ship, she is supported in the dock, or
upon a wharf, by a number of solid blocks of timber placed at equal
distances from, and parallel to, each other, as may be seen in the article
<span class='sc'>Lanching</span>; she is then said to be on the stocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first piece of timber laid upon the blocks is generally the keel; I
say <i>generally</i>, because, of late, a different method has been adopted in some
of the royal dock-yards, by beginning with the floor-timbers; the artists
having found that the keel is often apt to rot during the long period
of building a large ship of war. The pieces of the keel, as exhibited in
plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. are scarfed together, and bolted, forming one entire piece, A A.
which constitutes the length of the vessel below. At one extremity of
the keel is erected the <i>stem</i>. It is a strong piece of timber incurvated
nearly into a circular arch, or, according to the technical term, <i>compassing</i>,
so as to project outwards at the upper-end, forming what is
called the <i>rake</i> forward. In small vessels this is framed of one piece,
but in large ships it is composed of several pieces scarfed and bolted
together, as expressed in the explanation of plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span>,
and in those terms separately. At the other extremity of the keel, is
elevated the stern-post, which is always of one entire strait piece. The
heel of it is let into a mortise in the keel, and having its upper-end to
hang outwards, making an obtuse angle with the keel, like that of the
stem: this projection is called the <i>rake</i> abaft. The stern-post, which
ought to support the stern, contains the iron-work or hinges of the rudder,
which are called <i>googings</i>, and unites the lower-part of the ship’s
sides abaft. See the connexion of those pieces in the <span class='sc'>Elevation</span>, pl. I.</p>

<p class='c008'>Towards the upper-end of the stern-post, and at right angles with
its length, is fixed the middle of the <i>wing-transom</i>, where it is firmly
bolted. Under this is placed another piece parallel thereto, and called
the deck-transom, upon which the after-end of the lower-deck is supported.
Parallel to the deck-transom, and at a proper distance under it,
another piece is fixed to the stern-post, called the first transom, all of
which serve to connect the stern-post to the <i>fashion pieces</i>. Two more transoms,
called the second and third, are also placed under these, being likewise
attached to the fashion pieces, into which the extremities of all the
transoms are let, as exhibited in plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. fig. 1. The fashion-pieces are
formed like the other timbers of the ship, and have their heels resting
on the upper-part of the kelson, at the after extremity of the floor ribbands.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these pieces, viz. the transoms, the fashion-pieces, and their top-timbers,
being strongly united into one frame, are elevated upon the
stern-post, and the whole forms the structure of the stern, upon which
the galleries and windows, with their ornaments, are afterwards built,</p>

<p class='c008'>The stem and stern-post being thus elevated upon the keel, to which
they are securely connected by knees and arched pieces of timber bolted
to both; and the keel being raised at its two extremities by pieces of
dead-wood, the midship <i>floor-timber</i> is placed across the keel, whereto it
is bolted through the middle. The floor-timbers before and abaft the
midship-frame are then stationed in their proper places upon the keel;
after which the <i>kelson</i>, which, like the keel, is composed of several pieces
scarfed together, is fixed across the middle of the floor-timbers, to
which it is attached by bolts driven through the keel, and clinched on
the upper-part of the kelson. The futtocks are then raised upon the
floor-timbers, and the <i>hawse-pieces</i> erected upon the cant-timbers in the
fore-part of the ship. The top-timbers on each side are next attached
to the head of the futtocks, as already explained in the article <i>naval</i>
<span class='sc'>Architecture</span>. The frames of the principal timbers being thus completed,
are supported by ribbands, as exhibited in the plate referred to
from the article <span class='sc'>Ribbands</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ribs of the ship being now stationed, they proceed to fix on the
planks, of which the wales are the principal, being much thicker and
stronger than the rest; as is represented in the <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>. The
harpins, which may be considered as a continuation of the wales at their
fore-ends, are fixed across the hawse-pieces, and surround the fore-part
of the ship. The planks that inclose the ship’s sides are then brought
about the timbers, and the <i>clamps</i>, which are of equal thickness with
the wales, fixed opposite to the wales within the ship; these are used to
support the ends of the beams, and accordingly stretch from one end of
the ship to the other. The <i>thick stuff</i>, or strong planks of the bottom
within-board, are then placed opposite to the several scarfs of the timbers,
to reinforce them throughout the ship’s length. The planks employed
to line the ship, called the <i>ceiling</i>, or <i>foot-waling</i>, is next fixed in
the intervals between the thick-stuff of the hold. The <i>beams</i> are afterwards
laid across the ship to support the decks, and are connected to
the side by lodging and hanging knees; the former of which are exhibited
in their proper stations in plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. F. and the hanging ones, together
with the breadth, thickness, and position of the keel, floor-timbers,
futtocks, top timbers, wales, clamps, thick-stuff, planks within
and without, beams, decks, &amp;c. are seen in the <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cable-bits being next erected, the <i>carlings</i> and <i>ledges</i>, which are
represented in plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. and described in their proper places, are disposed
between the beams to strengthen the deck. The <i>water-ways</i> are
then laid on the ends of the beams throughout the ship’s length, and the
spirketting fixed close above them. The upper-deck is then planked,
and the <i>string</i> placed under the <i>gunnel</i> or <i>plansheer</i> in the waist. The disposition
of those latter pieces on the timbers, viz. the water-ways,
spirketting, upper-deck, string, and gunnel, are also represented in
the <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>They proceed next to plank the quarter-deck and forecastle, and to
fix the <i>partners</i> of the masts and capsterns with the <i>coamings</i> of the hatches.
The <i>breast-hooks</i> are then bolted across the stem and bow within-board,
the <i>step</i> of the fore-mast placed on the kelson; and the <i>riders</i>, exhibited
in the <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>, fayed on the inside of the timbers to reinforce
the sides in different places of the ship’s length. The <i>pointers</i>, if any,
are afterwards fixed across the hold diagonally to support the beams;
and the <i>crotches</i> stationed in the after-hold to unite the half-timbers. The
<i>steps</i> of the main-mast and capsterns are next placed; the planks of the
lower-decks and orlop laid; the <i>navel hoods</i> fayed on the hawse-holes;
and the <i>knee of the head</i>, or cutwater, connected to the stem. The figure
of the head is then erected, and the <i>trail-board</i> and cheeks fixed on the
sides of the knee.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>taffarel</i> and <i>quarter pieces</i>, which terminate the ship abaft, the former
above, and the latter on each side, are then disposed; and the stern
and quarter galleries framed and supported by their brackets. The <i>pumps</i>,
with their well, are next fixed in the hold; the <i>limber-boards</i> laid on
each side of the kelson, and the <i>garboard</i> strake fixed on the ship’s bottom
next to the keel without.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hull being thus fabricated, they proceed to separate the apartments
by <i>bulk-heads</i>, or partitions; to frame the <i>port-lids</i>; to fix the <i>catheads</i>
and <i>chess-trees</i>; to form the <i>hatchways</i> and <i>scuttles</i>, and fit them
with proper covers or <i>gratings</i>. They next fix the ladders whereby to
mount or descend the different hatchways, and build the <i>manger</i> on the
lower deck, to carry off the water that runs in at the hawse-holes when
the ship rides at anchor in a sea. The bread-room and magazines are
then lined, and the <i>gunnel</i>, <i>rails</i>, and <i>gangways</i>, fixed on the upper
part of the ship. The <i>cleats</i>, <i>kevels</i>, and <i>ranges</i>, by which the ropes are.
fastened, are afterwards bolted or nailed to the sides. in different places.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>rudder</i>, being fitted with its irons, is next hung to the stern-post;
and the <i>tiller</i>, or bar, by which it is managed, let into a mortise at its
upper-end. The <i>scuppers</i>, or leaden tubes, that carry the water off from
the decks, are then placed in holes cut through the ship’s sides; and the
<i>standards</i>, represented in the <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>, bolted to the beams and
sides above the decks to which they belong. The poop-lanthorns are
last fixed upon their cranes over the stern, and the bilge-ways, or cradles,
placed under the bottom, to conduct the ship steadily into the
water whilst lanching.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the various pieces, which have been mentioned above, are explained
at large in their proper places, with references to their figures according
to the plan of this work, it would have been superfluous to have entered
into a more particular description of them here. It is perhaps necessary
to observe, that as the theory ought always to precede the practice,
this article would probably be much better understood by previously
reading that of <i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>, which may be considered as a
proper introduction to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUILT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fabrique</span></i>, the particular form or structure of a ship, by which
she is distinguished from others of a different class or nation. Thus a ship
is said to be frigate-built, galley-built, a hag-boat, a pink, a cat, &amp;c. or
to be English-built, French-built, American-built, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>BULK-HEADS, certain partitions, or walls, built up in several places
of a ship between two decks, either lengthwise or across, to form and
separate the various apartments. Some of those which are built across
the ship are remarkably strong. See the article <span class='sc'>Close-Quarters</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BULL’S-EYE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cosse</span></i>. a sort of small pulley in the form of a ring, having
a rope spliced round the outer edge of it, (which is hollowed to admit of
the rope) and a large hole in the middle for another rope to slide in. It
is seldom used but for the main and fore bowline-bridles of some ships,
particularly the colliers of Northumberland, &amp;c. It is spliced in the
outer-end of the bowline, and sliding along the bridle, to rest in the most
apposite place, draws it tight above and below. This implement is
more frequently used by Dutch than English seamen.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUMKIN, or <span class='sc'>Boomkin</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boute-lof</span></i>, a short boom or bar of timber, projecting
from each <i>bow</i> of a ship, to extend the lower-edge of the fore-sail
to windward; for which purpose there is a large block fixed on its
outer end, through which the rope is passed that is fastened to the
lower-corner of the sail to windward, called the <i>tack</i>; and this being
drawn tight down, brings the corner of the sail close to the block,
which being performed, the <i>tack</i> is said to be <i>aboard</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bumkin is secured by a strong rope which confines it downward
to the ship’s bow, to counter-act the strain it bears from the fore-sail
above, dragging it upwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUNT, the middle part, or cavity of the principal square sails, as the
main-sail, fore-sail, top-sails, and top-gallant-sails. If one of those sails
is supposed to be divided into four equal parts, from one side to the
other, then may the two middle divisions, which comprehend half of
the sail, be properly called the limits of the bunt.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUNTINE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etamine</span></i>, a thin woollen stuff, of which the colours and
signals of a ship are usually formed.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUNTLINES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cargues fond</span></i>, are ropes fastened to the bottoms of the
square sails, to draw them up to the yards: they are inserted through
certain blocks above, or on the upper-part of the yard, whence passing
down-wards on the fore-part of the sail, they are fastened below to the
lower-edge in several places of the <i>bolt-rope</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUOY, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouée</span></i>, Fr.) a sort of close cask, or block of wood, fastened by a
rope to the anchor, to determine the place where the anchor is situated,
that the ship may not come too near it, to entangle her cable about
the stock, or the flukes of it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Buoys</span> are of various kinds; as,</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Can</i>-<span class='sc'>Buoys</span>; these are in the form of a cone, (see plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 8.) and
of this construction are all the buoys which are floated over dangerous
banks and shallows, as a warning to passing ships, that they may avoid
them. They are extremely large, that they may be seen at a distance,
and are fastened by strong chains to the anchors which are sunk for this
purpose at such places.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Nun</i>-<span class='sc'>Buoys</span>, are shaped like the middle frustum of two cones, abutting
upon one common base, (plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 9.) being casks, which are large in
the middle, and tapering, nearly to a point, at each end.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Wooden</i> <span class='sc'>Buoys</span>, are solid pieces of timber, sometimes in the shape of a
cylinder, and sometimes of a nun-buoy; they are furnished with one
or two holes, in which to fix a short piece of rope, whose two ends
being spliced together make a sort of circle or ring called the strop.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cable</i>-<span class='sc'>Buoys</span>, common casks employed to buoy up the cable in different
places from any rocky ground. In the harbour of Alexandria,
in Egypt, every ship is moored with at least three cables, and has three
or four of these buoys on each cable for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUOY-ROPE, the rope which fastens the buoy to the anchor: it
should be little more than equal in length to the depth of the water
where the anchor lies, as it is intended to float near, or immediately
above the bed of it, that the pilot may at all times know the situation
thereof. See plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. fig. 6. b is the anchor, c the buoy-rope, and d the
buoy floating on the surface of the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Buoy-Rope</span> is often extremely useful otherways, in drawing up
the anchor when the cable is broke. It should therefore be always of
sufficient strength for this purpose, or else the anchor may be lost through
negligence.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Slings of the</i> <span class='sc'>Buoy</span>, the ropes which are fastened about it, and by
which it is hung: they are curiously spliced round it, something resembling
the braces of a drum.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To stream the</i> <span class='sc'>Buoy</span>, is to let it fall from the ship’s side into the water,
which is always done before they let go the anchor, that it may not be
retarded by the buoy-rope as it sinks to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>BURTHEN, or <span class='sc'>Burden</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">port</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">byrthen</span></i>, Sax.) the weight or measure
of any species of merchandize that a ship will carry when fit for sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>To determine the burthen, or, in other words, the tonnage, of a
ship, it is usual to multiply the length of the keel into the extreme
breadth of the ship within-board, taken along the midship-beam, and
multiply the product by the depth in the <i>hold</i> from the plank joining to
the <i>kelson</i> upwards, to the main-deck, and divide the last product by 94,
then will the quotient be the burden required, in tons.</p>

<p class='c008'>BURTON, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bredindin</span></i>, a sort of small tackle, formed by two blocks or
pullies, till the rope becomes three or four fold, and acquires an additional
power in proportion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is generally employed to tighten the shrouds of the top-masts, but
may be otherways used to move or draw along any weighty body in the
<i>hold</i>, or on the <i>deck</i>, as anchors, bales of goods, large casks, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUSS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">buche</span></i>, (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">busse</span></i>, Germ.) a ship of two masts, used by the English
and Dutch in their herring fisheries. It is generally from fifty to seventy
tons burthen; being furnished with two small sheds or cabins, one at the
prow and the other at the stern; the former of which is employed as a
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUTT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">about</span></i>, the end of any plank in a ship’s side which unites with
the end of another, continuing its length: when a plank is loosened at
the end by the ship’s weakness or labouring, she is said to have started or
sprung a butt.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUTTOCK, the convexity of a ship behind, under the stern; it is
terminated by the counter above, and by the after part of the bilge below,
by the rudder in the middle, and by the quarter on the side.</p>

<p class='c008'>BUTTONS. See the article <span class='sc'>Bonnet</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>C.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>CABIN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabane</span></i>, a room or apartment in a ship where any of the
officers usually reside.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are many of these in a large ship; the principal of which is
designed for the captain, or commander. In ships of the line, this
chamber is furnished with an open gallery in the ships stern, as also
a little gallery on each quarter. The apartments where the inferior
officers or common sailors sleep and mess, are usually called births;
which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bed-places built up for the sailors at the ships side in merchantmen,
are also called cabins.</p>

<p class='c008'>CABLE, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cable</span></i>, Fr.) a large, strong rope of a considerable length,
used to retain a ship at anchor in a road, bay, or haven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cables are of various sorts and sizes. In Europe they are usually manufactured
of hemp; in Africa they are more frequently composed of
bass, which is a sort of long straw or rushes; and in Asia of a peculiar
sort of Indian grass.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cables, of what thickness soever, are generally formed of three ropes
twisted together, which are then called <i>strands</i>: each of these is
composed of three smaller strands; and those last of a certain number
of rope-yarns. This number is therefore greater or smaller in proportion
to the size of the cable required.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are some cables, however, manufactured of four strands; which
are chiefly the production of Italy and Provence.</p>

<p class='c008'>All ships ought to be furnished with at least three good cables; the
<i>sheet</i> cable, and the two <i>bowers</i>; best and small.</p>

<p class='c008'>All cables ought to be one hundred and twenty fathoms in length;
for which purpose the threads or yarns must be one hundred and eighty
fathoms; inasmuch as they are diminished one third in length by twisting.
Besides this length, it is necessary to splice at least two cables
together, in order to double the length when a ship is obliged to anchor
in deep water. For although it is not common to anchor in a
greater depth than forty fathoms, yet if there is only one cable, and the
ship rides in a storm and tempestuous sea, the anchor will of necessity
sustain the whole weight and violent jerking of the ship, in a direction
too nearly perpendicular. By this effort it will unavoidably be loosened
from its hold, and dragged by the ship, which thus driven from her
station, is in immediate danger of being wrecked on the nearest rocks
or shallows; whereas it is evident, that if the cable, by its great length,
were to draw more horizontally on the anchor, it would bear a much
greater force. See <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The long cable is not so apt to break as the short one; because it will
bear a great deal more stretching before it comes to the greatest strain:
it therefore resembles a sort of spring, which may be very easily extended,
and afterwards recovers its first state, as soon as the force
which extended it is removed. Besides all this, a ship will ride much
smoother with a long cable, and be less apt to <i>pitch</i>, or plunge deep in
the water with her fore-part.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the contrary, the short cable, being too nearly vertical to the anchor,
cannot bear such a strain, because it is charged with a greater
effort; and, as it will not bear stretching, may break at the first violent
tug. The ship also rides with much greater difficulty, labours extremely,
and often plunges all her fore-part under water.</p>

<p class='c008'>By what has been said on this subject, we may see how very necessary
it is to furnish a ship with sufficiency of cables, or what is called ground-tackle;
and what an inconsiderate policy it is in merchants to expose
their vessels to such evident dangers from the want of them. For we
may venture to assert, without violation of truth, that many good
ships have been lost only on account of a deficiency in this important
article.</p>

<p class='c008'>A cable ought neither to be twisted too much or too little; as in the
former state it will be extremely stiff, and difficult to manage; and in
the latter, it will be considerably diminished in its strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>All cables are to each other as the cubes of their diameters.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of threads also, of which each cable is composed, being
always proportioned to its length and thickness, the weight and value
of it are determined by this number. Thus a cable of ten inches in circumference,
ought to consist of four hundred and eighty-five threads;
and weigh one thousand nine hundred and forty pounds: and on this
foundation is calculated the following table, very useful for all persons
engaged in marine commerce, who equip merchant-ships on their own
account, or freight them for the account of others.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> CALK, or <span class='sc'>Caulk</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calfater</span></i>, (probably from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calage</span></i>, Fr. hemp) to
drive a quantity of oakum, or old ropes untwisted and drawn asunder,
into the seams of the planks, or into the intervals where the planks
are joined to each other in the ship’s decks or sides, in order to prevent
the entrance of water. After the oakum is driven very hard into these
seams, it is covered with hot melted pitch or resin, to keep the water
from rotting it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst the ancients, the first who made use of pitch in calking,
were the inhabitants of Phæacia, afterwards called Corsica. Wax and
resin appear to have been commonly used previous to that period; and
the Poles at this time use a sort of unctuous clay for the same purpose, on
their navigable rivers.</p>

<p class='c008'>CALL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sifflet</span></i>, a sort of whistle, or pipe, of silver or brass, used by the
boatswain and his mates to summon the sailors to their duty, and direct
them in the different employments of the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the call can be sounded to various strains, each of them is appropriated
to some particular exercise; such as hoisting, heaving, lowering,
veering away, belaying, letting-go a tackle, &amp;c. The act of winding
this instrument is called <i>piping</i>, which is as attentively observed by sailors,
as the beat of the drum to march, retreat, rally, charge, &amp;c. is obeyed
by soldiers.</p>

<p class='c008'>CALM, the state of rest which appears in the air and sea when there
is no wind stirring.</p>

<p class='c008'>That tract of the Atlantic ocean, situated between the tropic of Cancer
and the latitude of 29° north; or the space that lies between
the <i>trade</i> and the variable winds, is frequently subject to calms of
very long duration: and hence it has acquired, amongst seamen, the
name of the Calm Latitudes.</p>

<p class='c008'>A long calm is often more fatal to a ship than the severest tempest, because
if the ship is tight and in good condition, she may sustain the latter
without much injury; whereas in a long calm, the provision and water
may be entirely consumed, without any opportunity of obtaining a fresh
supply. The surface of the sea in a continued calm is smooth and

<p class='c008'>CAMBERED-DECK, the deck or flooring of a ship is said to be cambered,
or to lie cambering, when it is higher in the middle of the ship’s

when it lies irregular; a circumstance which renders the ship very unfit
for war. See the article <span class='sc'>Broken-backed</span>.</p>

short rope, and the tackle by which the cask so slung may be hoisted or
lowered, is hooked to the middle of the rope. See plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 8 and 9.
The canhooks commonly used ashore by brewers, &amp;c. are all iron, the

<p class='c008'>CANNON, a well known piece of artillery, mounted in battery on
the decks of a ship, and used in all naval engagements.</p>

<p class='c008'>This engine has already been so accurately described by a variety of
authors, that it may seem unnecessary to give a particular description
of it here. As it forms, however, so important an article in all the military
operations of the marine, it cannot, consistently with our plan,
be omitted in this place.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Cannon</span> then may be defined a long, conical fire-arm of brass or iron,
concave within, and smaller at the muzzle, or face, than at the opposite
end.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal parts of a sea-cannon, as represented in plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>. fig. 3,
are, 1st. The breech, A C, and its button, or cascabel, A h, called by
seamen the pomiglion. The breech is generally understood to be the
solid metal from the bottom of the concave cylinder to the cascabel,
which is the extremity of the cannon opposite to its muzzle.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. The trunnions, T, which project on each side like arms, and
serve to support the cannon near the middle of its length: on these it
may be poised, and held almost in <i>equilibrio</i>. As the metal is thicker at
the breech than towards the mouth, the trunnions are placed nearer to
that end than the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d. The bore, or caliber, which is comprehended between the dotted
lines, and particularly expressed in the longitudinal section of a thirty-two-pounder,

charged: the entrance of the bore is called the mouth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The use of these machines is to discharge upon the enemy globes or
balls of iron, called <i>shot</i>, which are therefore of various sizes, in proportion
to the caliber of the cannon. The diameter of the ball is always
somewhat less than the bore of the piece, that it may be discharged with
the greater ease, and not damage the piece by rubbing it too forcibly
in its passage; and the difference between these diameters is called the
windage of the cannon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The length of any cannon is always reckoned from the hind part of
the base ring, or beginning of the cascabel, to the extremity of the
muzzle. The second reinforce begins at the same circle where the first
terminates; and the chace at the same circle where the second reinforce
ends.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first reinforce therefore includes the base ring; the ogee nearest
thereto; the vent-field; the vent-astragal, and first reinforce-ring. The
second reinforce contains the ogee next to the first reinforce-ring and
the second reinforce-ring. The chace comprehends the ogee nearest to
the second reinforce-ring; the chace-girdle and astragal; and the muzzle
and astragal. The trunnions are always placed on the second reinforce,
so as that the breech part of the cannon may weigh something more than
the muzzle-part, to prevent the piece from starting up behind when it is
fired.</p>

<p class='c008'>A variety of experiments, made with great care and accuracy, prove
that powder when on fire possesses at least 4000<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> times more space than
when in grains. Therefore if we suppose that the quantity of powder
with which a cannon is charged possesses one fourth of a cubical foot in
grains, it will, when on fire, occupy the space of about 1000 cubical
feet. The same experiments evince also that the powder when inflamed,
is dilated equally round its center. One grain of powder fired
in the center of different concentric circles, round which grains of powder
are placed, shall therefore set fire to all those grains at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this principle it necessarily follows, that powder, when fired in
a cannon, makes at the same instant an equal effort on every part of the
inside of the piece, in order to expand itself about its center every way,
But as the resistance from the sides of the piece turns the action of the
powder, so as to follow the direction of the bore of the cannon when it
presses upon the ball, so as to force it outwards, it presses also on the
breech of the cannon; and this gives the piece a motion backwards,
that is called its <i>recoil</i> which, as we have already observed, is restrained
by the <i>breeching</i> and the convexity of the decks. The recoil in
some degree diminishes the action of the powder upon the shot. But
this cannot be avoided; for, if the carriages were fixed so as not to give
way to this motion, the action of the powder, or the effort that causes
the recoil, would tear them to pieces in a very short time.</p>

<p class='c008'>All pieces of artillery were formerly distinguished into the names of
sakers, culverins, cannon, and demi-cannon; but at present their names
are derived from the weight of the ball which they discharge: thus a
piece that discharges a ball of twenty-four pounds, is called a twenty-four-pounder;
and one that carries a shot of thirty-two pounds, a thirty-two-pounder;
and so of the rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>The metal of cannon is not equally thick in all parts, but is in some
measure proportioned to the force of the powder which it is to resist.
At the breech, where the effort is strongest, the thickness of the metal
is equal to the diameter of the corresponding shot. At the first reinforce,
where this begins to slacken, the thickness is somewhat less than at the
breech: at the second, where the force is still further diminished, the
thickness is more reduced than at the first: and, by the same rule,
the chace has less thickness than the second reinforce. The thickness of
the chace gradually diminishes from the trunnions to the mouth of the
piece; so that if a cannon was without cascabel, trunnion, and mouldings,
it would exactly resemble the frustum of a cone, or a cone deprived
of the small end.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a vessel of war, cannon are placed on a sort of wheeled sledge,
called the <i>carriage</i>, of which fig. 16. plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>. is the plan, and fig. 17. the
elevation. This carriage is composed of two large pieces of plank,
called sides or cheeks, connected together by means of cross-pieces,
which are either bolts, axle-trees, or transoms. The two axle-trees are
fixed across under the fore and hinder parts of the carriage, being supported
at their extremities by solid wooden wheels called trucks. The
transom is placed directly over the fore axle-tree, and exactly in the
middle of the height of the cheeks or side-pieces. The height of the
transom is equal to two diameters of the shot, and the breadth to one
diameter.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>a. The cap-squares, commonly called clamps in the sea-service.</p>

<p class='c008'>b. Eye-bolts, by which one end of the clamp is fixed to the carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>c. Joint-bolts, upon which the other end of the clamp is fixed over
the trunnions; after which it is fore-locked, to prevent the cannon
from starting out of its carriage when fired.</p>

<p class='c008'>b g. The cheeks or sides of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>d. The transom-bolt.</p>

<p class='c008'>e. The bed bolt, upon which the bed rests to support the breech of
the cannon. The bed is expressed by fig. 4.</p>

<p class='c008'>f. Hind axle-tree bolts.</p>

<p class='c008'>g. Breeching-bolts, with rings, through which the breechings pass.</p>

<p class='c008'>h. Loops, or eye-bolts, to which the gun-tackles are hooked.</p>

<p class='c008'>i. The fore axle-tree, with its trucks, k.</p>

<p class='c008'>l. The hind axle-tree, with its trucks, k.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wheels are firmly retained upon their axle-trees by means of iron
bolts passing through the latter without the wheels: these bolts are
called linch-pins.</p>

<p class='c008'>The breadth of the wheels is always equal to that of the cheeks; but
the height of the cheeks and diameter of the trucks must conform to the
height of the gun-ports above the deck. The carriages of the lower
tiers should therefore be so formed, that when the breech of the cannon
lies upon the hind axle-tree, the muzzle of the piece should touch above
the port, as expressed in fig. 19. which represents a cannon secured by
its tackles and breechings, to prevent it from straining the ship as she
rolls in a stormy sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cannon are charged by putting down into the bottom first a quantity
of powder, one third or one half the weight of the ball. This is done
with an instrument, fig. 7. termed a <i>ladle</i> which is a kind of cylindrical
spoon, generally made of copper, and fixed to the end of a staff, called
its handle. Upon the powder is put in a wad of rope-yarn, formed like
a ball, which is pressed down upon the powder with the instrument expressed
by fig. 17. called a <i>rammer</i>. Upon this wad is put the ball or shot;
and to secure it in its place, another wad is firmly pressed down upon it,
which operation is called <i>ramming-home</i> the wad and shot. The touch-hole
of the piece is then filled with powder, from the upper-part of which a
little train is laid that communicates with it. The use of this train is
to prevent the explosion of the powder from operating directly upon the
instrument employed to fire the piece, which in that case might be
forced out of the hand of the gunner.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the modern pieces, a little gutter or channel is framed on the upper
part of the breech, to prevent the train from being dispersed by
the wind. This channel reaches from the touch-hole to the base-ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cannon being pointed to its <i>object</i>, or the place which it is intended
to strike, the train is fired, and the flame immediately conveyed
to the powder in the touch-hole, by which it is further communicated
to that in the piece. The powder being kindled, immediately expands
so as to occupy a much greater space than when in grains, and thus
dilated it makes an effort on every side to force itself out. The ball
making less resistance than the sides of the piece, upon which the powder
presses at the same time, is driven out by its whole effort, and acquires
that violent motion which is well known to the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>In plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>. all the instruments necessary for charging cannon are
exhibited. Besides these already described, there is the spunge, fig. 10.
which is used to clean the piece after firing, and to extinguish any sparks
that may remain behind. In the land-service, the handle of the spunge
is nothing else than a long wooden staff; but in ships of war this handle,
that usually contains the rammer at its other end, is a piece of rope
well stiffened by <i>spun-yarn</i>, which is for this purpose firmly wound about
it. By this convenience the rammer becomes flexible, so that the piece
is charged within the ship, as the person who loads it may bend and
accommodate the length of the rammer to the distance between the
muzzle and the ship’s side; being at the same time sheltered from the
enemy’s musquetry, to which he would be exposed when using a wooden
rammer without the ship. To spunge a piece therefore is to introduce
this instrument into the bore, and thrusting it home to the farthest end
thereof, to clean the whole cavity. The figures 8 and 9 represent
spunges of a different kind; one of which is formed of sheep-skin, and
the other of the strongest bristles of a hog. See the article <span class='sc'>Exercise</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>worm</i>, of which there are also different kinds, fig. 6. and 9. is used
to draw the charge when necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bit, or priming-iron, is a kind of large needle, whose lower end
is formed into a gimblet, serving to clear the inside of the touch-hole,
and render it fit to receive the prime.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lint-stock is a kind of staff about three feet long, to the end of
which a match is occasionally fastened to fire the piece.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fluctuating motion of the sea renders it necessary to secure and
confine the artillery in vessels of war, by several ropes and pullies, which
are called the <i>gun-tackles</i> and <i>breechings</i>, without which they could never
be managed in a naval engagement. The breeching has been already
explained, as employed to restrain the recoil. The tackles * fig. 18, are
hooked to ring-bolts in the sides of the carriage, and to other ring-bolts
in the side of the ship, near the edges of the gun-ports, and are
used to draw the piece out into its place after it is loaded. Besides these,
there is another tackle hooked to the rear or <i>train</i> of the carriage, to
prevent the cannon from rolling into its place till it is charged: this is
called the train-tackle, and is exhibited in fig. 17.</p>

<p class='c008'>In ships of war, the cannon of the lower-decks are usually drawn into
the ship during the course of an expedition at sea, unless when they are
used in battle. They are secured by lowering the breech so as that the
muzzle shall bear against the upper-edge of the port, after which the
two parts of the breeching are firmly braced together by a rope which
crosses them between the front of the carriage and the port; which
operation is called <i>frapping</i> the breeching. The tackles are then securely
fastened about it with several turns of the rope extended from the
tackle and breeching, over the chace of the cannon, as represented in
fig. 19.</p>

<p class='c008'>The service of the artillery, or the method of employing it in a naval
action, is explained in the articles <span class='sc'>Engagement</span> and <span class='sc'>Exercise</span>.
The manner of pointing, or directing them to different objects; the
effects of different quantities of powder upon the cannonball; and the
different lines described by its flight, are also treated at large in the
article <span class='sc'>Range</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>For an account of the particular number of men appointed to manage
the different degrees of cannon, and the arrangement or distribution
of the cannon according to the several classes of ships, see <span class='sc'>Quarters</span>
and <span class='sc'>Rate</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following judicious remarks for increasing the strength of the
British navy, by changing the cannon used in ships of war into others
of equal weight but of greater bore, have been selected from the proposal
of the late ingenious Mr. Robins.</p>

<p class='c008'>The advantage of large cannon over those of a smaller bore is so
generally acknowledged, that a particular discussion of it might perhaps
be spared. * * *</p>

<p class='c008'>“The most important advantage of heavy bullets is this, that with
the same velocity they break holes out in all solid bodies in a greater
proportion than their weight; that is, for instance, a twenty-four pound
shot will, with the same velocity, break out a hole in any wall, rampart,
or solid beam, in which it lodges, above eight times larger than
will be made by a three pound shot; for its diameter being double,
it will make a superficial fracture above four times as great as the three-pounder,
(more of a smaller hole being closed up by the springing of
the solid body than of a great one) and it will penetrate to more than
twice the depth; by this means the firmest walls of masonry are easily
cut through their whole substance by heavy shot, which could never be
affected by those of a smaller caliber; and in ships the strongest beams
and masts are hereby fractured, which a very great number of small
bullets would scarcely injure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To this last advantage of large cannon, which is indeed a capital
one, there must be that of carrying the weight of their bullet in grape
or lead shot, and thereby annoying the enemy more effectually than
could be done by ten times the number of small pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These are the principal advantages of large cannon, and hence it is
no wonder that those entrusted with the care of the British navy have
always endeavoured to arm all ships with the largest cannon they could
with safety bear; and indeed, within these last hundred years, great
improvements have been made on this head, by reducing the weight of
many of the species of cannon, and thereby enabling the same ships to
carry guns of a larger bore: and, very lately, the six pounders in some
of the smaller ships have been changed for nine pounders of a larger
fabric than usual, which hath been justly esteemed a very great addition,
to the strength of those ships.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The importance then of allotting to all ships the largest cannon they
can with safety bear being granted, it remains to shew on what foundation
a change is proposed to be made in the fabric of all pieces from the
present eighteen pounders downwards, so that they may be changed
for others of the same, or less weight, but of a larger bore. This proposition
turns on the following considerations.—The species of cannon
proper for each ship is limited by the weight of the pieces; and when
the charge and effort of the bullet are assigned, this weight in each
species is, or ought to be determined by the following circumstances;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That they shall not be in danger of bursting;</div>
      <div class='line'>That they shall not recoil too boisterously;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that they shall not heat too much in frequent firing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“All this is to be done by a proper quantity of metal properly disposed;
and when the pieces are secured from these accidents, all additional
weight of metal, is not only useless but prejudicial.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now what dimensions and weight of metal are more than sufficient
for these purposes, we may learn from the present practice of the navy,
in the fabric of the thirty-two pounders, the heaviest guns in common
use; these are made to weigh (if the author’s information be right) from
fifty-two to fifty-three hundred weight; that is somewhat less than an
hundred and two-thirds for each pound of bullet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“From this then the author concludes, that any smaller piece, made
upon the model of these thirty-two pounders, and having their weight
proportioned in the same manner to the weight of their bullet, will
fully answer all the purposes recited above, and will be of unexceptionable
service.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he founds his opinions on these two principles: first, that the
strength of iron, or of any other metal, is in proportion to its substance;
so that, for instance, where it has one half the substance, it has one half
the strength; and this supposition, he presumes, will be scarcely contested.
Secondly that the force of different quantities of powder fired
in spaces which they respectively fill, is not exactly in the proportion of
those quantities; but the lesser quantity has in proportion the least force:
that is, for instance, the force of one pound of powder, in like circumstances,
is less than one half the force of two pounds. And this principle
the author has deduced from many repeated and diversified trials
of his own; and he believes it will be found agreeable to all the observations
which have been made, or shall be made, on this subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>“From these two considerations, he hopes, it will be granted him,
that, if two pieces, a large one and a small one, are made with all their
dimensions in proportion to the diameter of their respective bullets, and
consequently their weights in the same proportion with the weights of
their bullets, then the larger piece, with the same proportion of powder,
will be more strained, will heat more, and recoil more than the smaller.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hence then, as we are assured, that the present thirty-two pounders
are of a sufficient strength and weight for all marine purposes, we have
the greatest reason to suppose, that, if all the pieces of an inferior caliber
were formed upon the same model, measuring by the diameter of the
bullet, these smaller pieces would not be defective, either in strength or
weight, but would be to the full as serviceable on ship-board, as the present
pieces, which are so much overloaded with metal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The author’s scheme then for augmenting the force of the present
sea-batteries, is no more than this plain principle, that all ship-guns
should be cast upon the model of the thirty-two pounders, measuring by
the diameter of the respective bullet; so that for each pound of bullet,
there should be allowed one hundred and two thirds of metal only.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The advantages of this scheme will appear, by the following comparison
of the weight of the present pieces with their weight proposed
by this new fabric.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hence then it appears, that the twenty-four-pounders will be eased of
six or eight hundred of useless metal; and instead of an inferior caliber
now used, much larger ones of the same weight may be borne, especially
when it is remembered, that this computation exceeds even the present
proportion of the thirty-two-pounders; so that from the above projected
eighteen pounders, for instance, two or three hundred weight may be
safely taken.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The nine pounders lately cast, being, as the author is informed,
still lighter than what is here represented, they may perhaps be only
transformed into twelve pounders; but this will be a very great addition
of strength, and the twelve-pounders thus borne will be considerably
lighter than the smallest nine-pounders now in use. The weight of
the present three-pounders are not remembered exactly by the author;
but he doubts not, but they are heavier than the proposed six-pounders,
and may therefore be changed for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That many objections will be made to the present proposal is not to
be questioned; but, as they will equally hold against the use of the present
thirty-two-pounders, which are known to be guns of unexceptionable
service, that alone, it is conceived, will be an answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it be supposed (as ancient practice is always favourably heard)
that the excesses in the proportionate weight of the small pieces must
have been originally founded on some approved principle, or otherwise
they could not have been brought into use, it may be answered, that a
hundred years since there were four-pounders made use of, which were
heavier than some of the present nine-pounders, and had the same prescription
to plead in their behalf.—Perhaps the origin of this excess in
the smaller pieces may be accounted for by supposing, that when guns
are used in batteries on shore, their length cannot be in proportion to
the diameter of their bore; because the parapet being of a considerable
thickness, a short piece would, by its blast, ruin the embrasures; and
the smaller pieces being for this reason made nearly of the same length
with the larger, did hence receive their additional weight of metal. But
this reason holds not at sea, where there is no other exception to the
shortness of a piece, but the loss of force, which, in the instances here
proposed, is altogether inconsiderable; for the old twelve-pounders,
for example, being in length from nine feet to nine feet, and a half, the
new ones here proposed will be from seven feet to seven and a half long.
The difference in the force of the bullet, fired from these different pieces,
is but little; and it will hereafter appear, that in the present subject
much greater differences than these are of no consequence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it should be said, that the new fabric here proposed must have
the present allowance of powder (which in the smaller pieces is half the
weight of the ball) diminished, and that it must be reduced to the rate
of the thirty-two-pounders, which is only seven-sixteenths of the
weight of the ball; it is answered, that if the powder in all ship-cannon
whatever, was still farther reduced to one-third of the weight of the ball,
or even less, it would be a considerable advantage, not only by the saving
of ammunition, but by keeping the guns cooler and more quiet, and
at the same time more effectually injuring the ships of the enemy<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a>; for
with the present allowance of powder the guns are heated, and their
tackles and furniture strained, and this only to render the bullet less
efficacious than it would prove if impelled by a smaller charge. Indeed
in battering of walls, which are not to be penetrated by a single shot
from any piece whatever, the velocity of the bullet, how much soever
augmented, still produces a proportionate effect, by augmenting the
depth to which it penetrates: but the sides of the strongest ships, and
the greater part of her timbers, are of a limited thickness, insufficient
to stop the generality of cannon bullets, fired at a reasonable distance,
even with a less charge than is here proposed. And it is a matter of
experiment, that a bullet, which can but just pass through a piece of
timber, and loses almost all its motion thereby, has a much better
chance of rending and fracturing it, than if it passed through it with a
much greater velocity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That a much better judgment may be made of the reasonableness of
this speculation, the author thinks proper to add (and he believes future
experience will not contradict him) that a twelve-pounder, as here proposed,
which is one of the smallest pieces at present under consideration,
when charged with one-third of the weight of the bullet in powder, will
penetrate a beam of the best seasoned toughest oak, to more than
twenty inches depth; and if, instead of one solid beam, there are a
number of small ones, or of planks laid together; then allowing for
rending and tearing, frequent in such cases, he doubts not, but it will
often go through near double that thickness, and this any where within
a hundred yards distance: that is, any where within that distance,
which the most experienced officers have recommended for naval engagements.
In the same distance, a bullet from the twelve-pounders
now in use, charged with half the weight of powder, will penetrate
about one-third part deeper: but if the efforts of each piece are compared
together at five hundred yards distance, the differences of their
forces will not be considerable. If this be so, it will not be asserted, I
imagine, that the twelve-pounder here proposed is less useful, or less
efficacious, for all naval purposes, than the weightier twelve-pounder
hitherto made use of.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The author has in this proposal fixed on the thirty-two pounders,
as the standard for the rest; because experience has long authorised
them. But from the trials he has made, he is well satisfied, a much
greater reduction of weight, than is here proposed, might safely take
place; and that one fourth, or even one fifth of the weight of the bullet
in powder, if properly disposed, is abundantly sufficient for every species
of ship-guns<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a>. However, the author is far from desiring, that his
speculations should be relied on in an affair of this nature, where he
pretends not to have tried the very matter he proposes, but founds his
opinion on certain general principles and collateral experiments, which
he conceives, he may apply to the present case without error. He
would himself recommend an experimental examination of this proposal,
as the only one to which credit ought to be given. What he intends
by the present paper, is to represent it as a matter worthy of consideration,
and really such as it appeared to him: if those to whose censure
he submits it, are of the same opinion, there is an obvious method
of determining how far his allegations are conclusive; and that is by
directing one of these pieces to be cast, a twelve-pounder for instance,
and letting it be proved with the same proportion of powder allotted
for the proof of the thirty-two-pounders: Then if this piece be fired a
number of times successively on a carriage, and its recoil, and degree
of heat be attended to, and if the penetration of its bullet into a thick
butt of oak-beams or plank be likewise examined, a judgment may
thence be formed, of what may be expected from the piece in real service;
and the result of these trials will be the most incontestable confutation
or confirmation of this proposal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>CANNONADE, as a term of the marine, may be defined the application
of artillery to the purposes of naval war, or the direction of its
efforts against some distant object intended to be seized or destroyed, as
a ship, battery, or fortress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cannonading is therefore used in a vessel of war to take, sink, or
burn the enemy’s ships, or to drive them from their defences ashore,
and to batter and ruin their fortifications.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since a large man of war may be considered as a combination of floating
batteries, it is evident that the efforts of her artillery must in general
be greatly superior to those of a fortress on the sea-coast: I say in
general, because on some particular occasions her situation may be extremely
dangerous, and her cannonading ineffectual. Her superiority
consists in several circumstances, as, the power of bringing her different
batteries to converge to one point; of shifting the line of her attack so
as to do the greatest possible execution against the enemy; or to lie
where she will be the least exposed to his shot: and chiefly because, by
employing a much greater number of cannon against a fort than it can
possibly return, the impression of her artillery against stone-walls soon,
becomes decisive and irresistible. Besides these advantages in the attack,
she is also greatly superior in point of defence: because the cannon shot
passing with rapidity through her sides, seldom do any execution out of
the line of their flight, or occasion much mischief by their splinters:
whereas they very soon shatter and destroy the faces of a parapet, and
produce incredible havoc amongst the men, by the fragments of the
stones, &amp;c. A ship may also retreat when she finds it too dangerous to
remain longer exposed to the enemy’s fire, or when her own fire cannot
produce the desired effect. Finally, the fluctuating situation of a ship,
and of the element on which she rests, renders the efforts of bombs very
uncertain, and altogether destroys the effect of the <i>ricochet</i>, or rolling
and bounding shot, whose execution is so pernicious and destructive in
a fortress or land-engagement; both of which, however, a ship may
apply with great success. See <span class='sc'>Range</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chief inconveniency to which a ship is exposed, on the contrary,
is, that the low-laid cannon in a fort near the brink of the sea, may
strike her repeatedly, on or under the surface of the water, so as to sink
her before her cannonade can have any considerable efficacy.</p>

<p class='c008'>CANOE, a sort of Indian boat or vessel, formed of the trunk of a
tree hollowed, and sometimes of several pieces of the bark fastened
together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Canoes are of various sizes, according to the uses for which they may
be designed, or the countries wherein they are formed. The largest are
made of the cotton tree, some of which will carry between twenty and
thirty hogsheads of sugar or molasses. Some are made to carry sail,
and for this purpose are steeped in water till they become pliant, after
which their sides are extended, and strong beams placed between them,
on which a deck is afterwards laid that serves to support their sides.
The other sorts very rarely carry sail, unless when going before the
wind: their sails are made of a sort of silk grass or rushes. They are
commonly rowed with paddles, which are pieces of light wood somewhat
resembling a corn-shovel; and instead of rowing with it horizontally,
like an oar, they manage it perpendicularly. The small canoes
are very narrow, having only room for one person in breadth, and
seven or eight lengthways. The rowers, who are generally negroes or
American savages, are very expert in managing their paddles uniformly,
and in ballancing the canoes properly with their bodies, which would
be difficult for a stranger to do, how well accustomed soever to the
conducting of European boats, because the canoes are extremely light,
and liable to be overturned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The American Indians, when they are under the necessity of landing
to avoid a water-fall, or of crossing the land from one river to another,
carry their canoes on their heads; till they arrive at a place where they
can lanch them again.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following curious account of the canoes of the Esquimaux Indians
in Labrador, has been lately transmitted to the author, which he
apprehends will not be displeasing to his readers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Esquimaux canoe has a light wooden frame, and the shell, instead
of plank, is made with seal-skins sewed together, which are not only
extended round the bottom and sides, but likewise over the top; forming
a compleat deck, and having only one opening, conveniently
framed and situated to admit the Indian into his seat. A flat hoop
is fitted to this hole, rising about four inches, to which the surrounding
skin is sewed. The Indian’s seal-skin jacket, being of a
proper length, he can occasionally bind the skirt of it round the outside
of this hoop; by which means he keeps the canoe free from water,
and is enabled to pursue his game far from land or in stormy seas.
His paddle is about ten feet long, light, and flat at each end, with
which he both rows and steers with great velocity and exactness. Mr.
Crantz, in his History of Greenland, informs us, that the young men
in their exercise are taught to overset their canoes, and when the bottom
is upward, to recover, by the dextrous management of their paddle,
their former upright position, the men rising again either on the
side by which they went down, or on the contrary, as they please.
The construction of this extraordinary little vessel, so admirably well
adapted to the purposes of its owner, does the greatest credit to the ingenuity
of this savage people. Though natives of the extensive country
of Labrador, they inhabit only the sea-coasts, particularly the islands,
the interior parts being no less barren, and possessed by other wandering
tribes, their perpetual enemies and superiors at land; so that they
are reduced to almost an entire dependance upon the sea for the common
necessaries of life. Seals-flesh and oil are amongst the chief articles
of their food; and with the skins they make tents, canoes, and apparel.
Those islands on which the sea-fowl breed, they visit for their eggs and
young; and kill birds in the water with their darts. We are surprised,
that provided thus, they should do so much execution amongst these
creatures; but when we behold a party of savages, each in his canoe,
with only his harpoon and his lance, pursue, attack, and kill the largest
whale, how justly are we filled with admiration. The whale’s flesh and
oil they eat; and the tough substance of the gills, commonly called
whalebone, they apply very ingeniously to a great variety of uses;
trafficking with the overplus for such European goods as they want.
In their language, the canoe is called <i>kaiak</i>, or man’s-boat, to distinguish
it from <i>umiak</i>, the woman’s boat. The latter is a large boat managed by
the women for transporting their families and possessions, when they shift
their encampment from place to place, as most convenient for the particular
hunting of the season. A kind of wolf-dog, natural to that
country, is the only animal they breed for food. The same canoes, language,
customs, and way of life, being common to the Greenlanders
with the Esquimaux, it is evident they have been originally one people.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a Greenland canoe in the Repository of the Royal Society,
covered with seal-skins, and exactly conformable to the above description.</p>

<p class='c008'>CANTING, as a sea-phrase, denotes the act of turning any thing
about.</p>

<p class='c008'>CANT-<span class='sc'>Timbers</span>, in ship-building, those timbers which are situated
at the two ends of a ship. They derive their name from being <i>canted</i>,
or raised obliquely from the keel; in contradistinction to those whose
planes are perpendicular to it. The upper-ends of those on the <i>bow</i>, or
fore-part of the ship, are inclined to the stem; as those in the <i>after</i>, or
hind-part, incline to the stern-post above. See the articles <span class='sc'>Timber</span> and
<i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal of these last is the fashion-piece, which forms the outline
of the counter, terminating it on the sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chouquet</span></i>, a strong, thick block of wood, used to confine two
masts together, when the one is erected at the head of the other, in
order to lengthen it. It is for this purpose furnished with two holes
perpendicular to its length and breadth, and parallel to its thickness;
one of these is Square, and the other round; the former being solidly
fixed upon the upper-end of the lower-mast, whilst the latter receives
the mast employed to lengthen it, and Secures it in this position.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal caps of a ship are those of the lower-masts, which are
fitted with a strong eye-bolt on each side, wherein to hook the block
by which the top-mast is drawn up through the cap; the process of
which is explained in the article <span class='sc'>Mast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The breadth of all caps is equal to twice the diameter of the top-mast,
and the length to twice the breadth. The thickness of the main and
fore-caps is half the diameter of their breadths; the mizen-cap three-sevenths,
and the top-mast-caps two-fifths of their respective breadths.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same manner as the top-mast slides up through the cap of the
lower-mast, the <i>top-gallant mast</i> slides up through the cap of the top-mast.
The cap is represented by fig. 9. plate <a href='#II'>II</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAPE, a promontory, or head-land, which projects into the sea farther
than the rest of the coast.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAPPANUS, a name given by some authors to the worm which
adheres to, and gnaws the bottom of a ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cappanus is extremely pernicious to ships, particularly in the
East and West Indies: to prevent this, several ships have lately been
sheathed with copper; the first trial of which was made on his majesty’s
frigate Alarm.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAP-SQUARE. See the article <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAPSTERN, or <span class='sc'>Capstan</span>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabestan</span></i>, Fr.) a strong, massy column of
timber, formed like a truncated cone, and having its upper extremity
pierced with a number of holes to receive the bars or levers. It is let
down perpendicularly through the decks of a ship, and is fixed in such
manner, that the men, by turning it horizontally with their bars, may
perform any work which requires an extraordinary effort.</p>

<p class='c008'>A capstern is composed of several parts, (see plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 11.) where
A is the barrel, b the whelps, c the drum-head, and d the spindle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whelps rise out from the main body of the capstern like buttresses,
to enlarge the sweep; so that a greater portion of the cable, or whatever
rope encircles the barrel, may be wound about it at one turn, without
adding much to the weight of the capstern. The whelps reach
downwards from the lower part of the drum-head to the deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 10. The drum-head is a broad cylindrical piece of wood,
resembling a mill-stone, and fixed immediately above the barrel and
whelps. On the outside of this piece are cut a number of square holes,
parallel to the deck, to receive the bars.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pivot, or spindle, d, which is shod with iron, is the axis or foot
upon which the capstern rests, and turns round in the saucer, which is
a sort of iron socket let into a wooden stock or standard, called the step,
resting upon, and bolted to the beams.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the different parts of the capstern above explained, it is furnished
with several appurtenances, as the <i>bars</i>, the <i>pins</i>, the <i>pawls</i>, the
<i>swifter</i>, and the <i>saucer</i>, already described.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bars are long pieces of wood, or arms, thrust into a number of
square holes in the drum-head all round, in which they are as the radii
of a circle, or the spokes to the nave of a wheel. They are used to
heave the capstern round, which is done by the men setting their breasts
against them and walking about, like the machinery of a horse-mill, till
the operation is finished.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pins, e, are little bolts of iron thrust perpendicularly through the
holes of the drum-head, and through a correspondent hole in the end
of the bar, made to receive the pins when the bars are fixed. They are
used to confine the bars, and prevent them from working out as the
men heave, or when the ship labours. Every pin is fastened to the
drum-head with a small iron chain; and, that the bars may exactly
fit their respective holes, they are all numbered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pawls, f, fig. 10. are situated on each side of the capstern, being
two short bars of iron, bolted at one end through the deck to the beams
close to the lower part of the whelps; the other end, which occasionally
turns round on the deck, being placed in the intervals of the whelps,
as the capstern turns, prevents it from recoiling or turning back by any
sudden jerk of the cable as the ship rises on the sea, which might greatly
endanger the men who heave. There are also hanging pawls g, g, fig. 12,
used for the same purposes, reaching from the deck above to the drum-head
immediately beneath it.</p>

<p><i>Plate ii.</i> &#8196; &#8196; &nbsp;<i>To pace <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The <i>swifter</i>, is a rope passed horizontally through holes in the outer
ends of the bars, and drawn very tight: the intent of this is to keep
the men steddy as they walk round, when the ship rocks, and to give
room for a greater number to assist by pulling upon the swifter itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most frequent use of the capstern is to heave in the cable, and
thereby remove the ship, or draw up the anchor. It is also used to wind
up any weighty body, as the masts, artillery, &amp;c. In merchant-ships
it is likewise frequently employed to discharge or take in the cargo,
particularly when consisting of weighty materials that require a great
exertion of mechanical powers to be removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are commonly two capsterns in a ship of war, the <i>main</i> and the
<i>gear</i> capstern; the former of which has two drum-heads, and may be
called a double one. This is represented by fig. 12. of plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. the latter
is exhibited in fig. 11.</p>

<p class='c008'>Formerly the bars of the capstern went intirely through the head of
it, and consequently were more than twice the length of the present
ones; the holes were therefore formed at different heights, as represented
in fig. 10. plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. But this machine had several inconveniencies,
such as the persons who heaved at the higher bars incommoding
those at the lower ones; the bars being lifted or lowered by the persons
who heaved at their opposite ends; some of the bars being too high, and
others two low, &amp;c. It has therefore been long intirely disused in the
navy. Some of these sort of capsterns, however, are still retained in merchant
ships, and are usually denominated crabs. The situation of the
bars in a crab, as ready for heaving, is represented in fig. 13. plate <a href='#II'>II</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To rig the</i> <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garnir</span></i>, is to fix the bars in their respective holes,
and thrust in the pins in order to confine them.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Surge the</i> <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">choquer</span></i>, is the order to slacken the rope heaved
round upon it, of which there is generally two turns and a half about
the barrel at once, and sometimes three turns.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To heave the</i> <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">virer au cabestan</span></i>, is to go round with it heaving
on the bars, and drawing in any rope of which the purchase is
created.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To come up the</i> <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>, is to let go the rope upon which they had
been heaving. See the French term <span class='sc'>Cabestan</span>, and the phrases annexed
thereto.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To pawl the</i> <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>, is to fix the pawls to prevent it from recoiling
during any pause of heaving.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAPTAIN <i>of a ship of war</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capitaine du haut bord</span></i>, the officer who commands
a ship of the line of battle, or a frigate carrying twenty or more
cannon. The charge of a captain in his majesty’s navy is very comprehensive,
inasmuch as he is not only answerable for any bad conduct in
the military government, navigation, and equipment of the ship he
commands; but also for any neglect of duty, or ill management in his
inferior officers, whose several charges he is appointed to superintend
and regulate.</p>

<p class='c008'>On his first receiving information of the condition and quality of the
ship he is appointed to command, he must attend her constantly, and
hasten the necessary preparations to fit her for sea. So strict indeed are
the injunctions laid on him by the lord high admiral, or commissioners
of the admiralty, that he is forbid to lie out of his ship, from his arrival
on board, till the day of his discharge, unless by particular leave
from the admiralty, or his commander in chief.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is enjoined to shew a laudable example of honour and virtue to
the officers and men, and to discountenance all dissolute, immoral, and
disorderly practices, and such as are contrary to the rules of discipline
and subordination, as well as to correct those who are guilty of such
offences, as are punishable according to the usage of the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is ordered particularly to survey all the military stores which are
sent on board, and to return whatsoever is deemed unfit for service.
His diligence and application are required to procure his complement of
men; observing carefully to enter only such as are fit for the necessary
duty, that the government may not be put to improper expence. When
his ship is fully manned, he is expected to keep the established number
of men complete, and superintend the muster himself, if there is no
clerk of the check at the port.</p>

<p class='c008'>When his ship is employed on a cruising station, he is expected to keep
the sea the whole length of time previously appointed; but if he is compelled
by some unexpected accident to return to port sooner than the
limited time, he ought to be very cautious in the choice of a good situation
for anchoring, ordering the master, or other careful officers, to
sound, and discover the depths of water, and dangers of the coast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Previous to any possibility of engagement with an enemy, he is to
quarter the officers and men to the necessary stations according to their
office or abilities, and to exercise them in the management of the artillery,
that they may be more expert in the time of battle. See the articles
<span class='sc'>Exercise</span> and <span class='sc'>Quarters</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>His station in an engagement is on the quarter-deck; at which time
he is expected to take all opportunities of annoying his enemy, and improving
every advantage over him; to exhibit an example of courage
and fortitude to his officers and crew; and to place his ship opposite to
his adversary in such a position as that every cannon shall do effectual
execution. See <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the time of his arrival in port after his return from abroad, he is
to assemble his officers, and draw up a detail of the observations that
have been made during the voyage; of the qualities of the ship, as to
her trim, ballast, stowage, and manner of sailing, for the information
and direction of those who may succeed in command; and this account
is to be signed by himself and officers, and to be returned to the resident
commissioner of the navy at the port where the ship is discharged.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAREENING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire abattre</span></i>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cariner</span></i>, Fr.) the operation of heaving the
ship down on one side, by the application of a strong purchase to her
masts, which are properly supported for the occasion, to prevent them
from breaking with so great a strain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Careening is used to heave one of the ship’s sides so low in the water,
as, that her bottom being elevated above its surface on the other side,
(See Plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. fig. 5.) may be cleansed of any filth which adheres to it, by
<span class='sc'>Breaming</span>, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship is laid on a careen, every thing is taken out of her: she
is also said to careen, when inclining to one side at sea, as pressed with
a weight of sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>CARGO, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargement</span></i>, the whole lading, or quantity, of whatever species
of merchandise a ship is freighted with, in order to proceed from
port to port.</p>

<p class='c008'>CARLINGS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entremises</span></i>, short pieces of timber ranging fore and aft,
from one of the deck beams to another, into which their ends are scored:
they are used to sustain and fortify the smaller beams of the ship, and
are exhibited in the <span class='sc'>Deck</span>, plate <a href='#III'>III</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CARPENTER <i>of a ship</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charpentier</span></i>, an officer appointed to examine
and keep in order the frame of the ship, together with her masts, yards,
boats, and all other wooden machinery.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is his duty in particular to keep the ship <i>tight</i>; for which purpose he
ought frequently to review the decks, and sides, and to calk them when
it is found necessary. In the time of battle he is to examine up and
down, with all possible attention, in the lower apartments of the ship,
to stop any holes that may have been made in the sides by shot, with
wooden plugs provided, of several sizes, for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>CARTEL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cartel</span></i>, a ship commissioned in time of war to exchange the
prisoners of any two hostile powers; also to carry any particular request or
proposal from one to another: for this reason the officer who commands
her is particularly ordered to carry no cargo, ammunition, or implements
of war, except a single gun for the purpose of firing signals.</p>

<p class='c008'>CASTING, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abattre</span></i>, the motion of falling off, so as to
bring the direction of the wind on either side of the ship after it had
blown for some time right a-head.</p>

<p class='c008'>This term is particularly applied to a ship when her anchor first loosens
from the ground, when she is about to depart from any place where she
had anchored; and as she had probably rested at anchor with her head
to windward, it is plain she must turn it off, so as to <i>fill</i> the sails before
she can advance in her course, which operation is called casting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence she is said to cast the right way, or the wrong way. See <span class='sc'>Trim</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chatte</span></i>, a ship employed in the coal trade, formed from the Norwegian
model. It is distinguished by a narrow stern, projecting <i>quarters</i>,
a deep <i>waiste</i>, and by having no ornamental figure on the prow.</p>

<p class='c008'>These vessels are generally built remarkably strong, and carry from
four to six hundred tons; or, in the Language of their own mariners,
from twenty to thirty <i>keels</i> of coals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cat, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capon</span></i>, is also a sort of strong tackle, or complication of pullies, to
hook and draw the anchor perpendicularly up to the <i>cat-head</i>. The
use of this machine is represented in plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 14.</p>

<p class='c008'>CATAMARAN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">catimoran</span></i>, a sort of raft or float, formed by the fastening
a number of poles to each other sideways, and laying boards,
planks, &amp;c. on the top, so as to convey goods or passengers to some distant
place by water when no boat can be procured. This, however, can
only be performed when the surface of the water is not much agitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAT-HARPINGS, a purchase of ropes employed to brace in the
<i>shrouds</i> of the lower masts behind their yards, for the double purpose
of making the shrouds more tight, and of affording room to draw the
yards in more obliquely, to <i>trim</i> the sails for a side-wind, when they
are said to be close-hauled.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAT-HEADS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bossoirs</span></i>, two strong short beams of timber, which project
almost horizontally over the ship’s bows, on each side of the bow-sprit,
being like two radii which extend from a center taken in the direction
of the bow-sprit.</p>

<p class='c008'>That part of the cat-head which rests upon the fore-castle is securely
bolted to the beams: the other part projects like a crane, as above described,
and carries in its extremity two or three small wheels, or <i>sheaves</i>,
of brass, or strong wood, about which a rope called the <i>cat-fall</i> passes,
and communicates with the cat block, which also contains three sheaves.
The machine formed by this combination of pullies is called the <i>cat</i>,
which serves to pull the anchor up to the cat head without tearing the
ship’s side with its flukes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cat-head also serves to suspend the anchor clear of the bow, when
it is necessary to let it go: it is supported by a sort of knee, which is
generally ornamented with sculpture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cat-block is fitted with a large and strong hook, which catches the
ring of the anchor when it is to be drawn up. See a representation of
this article plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 14.</p>

<p class='c008'>CATS PAW, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">echars</span></i>, a light air of wind perceived at a distance in a
calm, by the impression made on the surface of the sea, which it sweeps
very lightly, and then decays.</p>

chief, and ought to be the strongest proportionably, as it reaches from
the van and rear. See  <span class='sc'>Line of Battle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='fss'>CHAFE</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">racquer</span></i>, is to rub or fret the surface of a cable, mast,

<p class='c008'>CHAIN-PUMP. See the article <span class='sc'>Pump</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHAINS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cadenes</span></i>, strong links or plates of iron, the lower ends of
which are bolted through the ship’s side to the timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are placed at short distances from each other on the ship’s out-side,
as being used to contain the blocks called <i>dead-eyes</i>, by which
the <i>shrouds</i> of the masts are extended. The disposition of the chains, and
that of their <i>channels</i>, is represented by the letters I, I, in the plane of
<span class='sc'>Elevation</span>, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. as also by fig. 16, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHAIN-SHOT, a particular kind of shot formed by fastening two
cannon-balls together with a short chain, and designed to mangle and
ruin a ship’s sails and rigging, or to destroy her masts and yards. See
<span class='sc'>Shot</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Top</i> CHAIN, a chain to sling the sail-yards in the time of battle, in order
to prevent them from falling down when the ropes, by which they
are hung, happen to be shot away, or rendered incapable of service.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHAIN-WALE. See <span class='sc'>Channel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHANNEL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manche</span></i>, in hydrography, the deepest part of a river, harbour,

<p class='c008'>CHANNELS, or <span class='sc'>Chain-Wales</span> <i>of a ship</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte bossoirs</span></i>, broad and thick
planks projecting horizontally from the ship’s out-side, a-breast of, and
somewhat behind, the masts. See plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 16.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are formed to extend the shrouds from each other, and from the
axis or middle line of the ship, so as to give a greater security and support
to the masts, as well as to prevent the shrouds from damaging the
gun-wale, or being hurt by rubbing against it. See also <span class='sc'>Shroud</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every mast has its chain-wales, which are either built above or below
the second deck-ports in a ship of the line: they are strongly connected
to the side by knees, bolts, and standards, besides being confined thereto
by the chains, whose upper ends pass through notches on the outer
edge of the chain-wales, so as to unite with the shrouds above.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHAPELING <i>a ship</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire chapelle</span></i>, the act of turning her round in a
light breeze of wind when she is close-hauled, so as that she will lie the
same way she did before. This is commonly occasioned by the negligence
of the steersman, or by a sudden change of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>A charter-party of affreightment settles the agreement in relation to
the freight and cargo of a ship between the merchant and master, or
commander of the vessel. It binds the master to deliver the cargo in
good condition at the place where his ship is to be discharged, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stern</i> <span class='sc'>Chases</span>, the cannons which are placed in the after-part of a ship’s
gun-room, pointing a-stern, and intended to strike any ship which chases
her, or other object in her rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHASING, the act of pursuing a ship or fleet, supposed or known to
be hostile. The admiral displayed the signal for a general chace, i. e. gave
the alarm to the whole fleet or squadron to pursue some other fleet in
sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHEARLY, a phrase which usually implies heartily, chearfully, or
quickly, as row chearly in the boats! lower away chearly! i. e. row
heartily, lower speedily, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHEEKS <i>of the mast</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jottereaux</span></i>, the faces or projecting parts on each
side of the masts, used to sustain the frame of the top, together with
the top-mast, which rests immediately upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHESTREES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">taquets d’ amure</span></i>, two pieces of wood bolted perpendicularly,
one on the starboard, and the other on the larboard side of the
ship. They are used to confine the <i>clue</i>, or lower corners of the main-sail;
for which purpose there is a hole in the upper part through which the
rope passes that usually extends the clue of the sail to windward. See
the article <span class='sc'>Tack</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chess-trees are commonly placed as far before the main-mast as the
length of the main-beam.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Clerk of the</i> CHECK, an officer in the royal dock-yards, who keeps a
muster or register of all the men employed aboard his majesty’s ships and
vessels, and also of all the artificers and others in the service of the navy
at the port where he is settled.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> CHINSE, is to thrust oakum into a seam or chink with the point
of a knife or chissel. This is chiefly used as a temporary expedient when
calking cannot be safely or conveniently performed.</p>

<p class='c008'>CHOCK, a sort of wedge used to confine a cask, or other weighty
body, in a certain place, and to prevent it from fetching way when the
ship is in motion, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLAMPS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bauquieres</span></i>, thick planks in a ship’s side, used to sustain the
ends of the beams. See the article <span class='sc'>Midship Frame</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The clamps extend from the stem to the fashion-pieces of the stern,
including the whole interior range of the side. They are placed close
under each deck so as to be securely fayed to all the timbers, to which
they are fastened by nails driven through the clamp, and penetrating
two thirds of the thickness of the timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The clamps of the lower and second decks ought to be equal in
thickness to half the corresponding timbers in that part, and as broad
as can be procured. In their disposition it is essentially necessary to
avoid their being wounded by the ports, as the strength and firmness
of a ship greatly depend on the substance and solidity of those pieces
which lie horizontally in her frame.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Clamps</span> are also small crooked plates of iron, fore-locked upon the
trunnions of the cannon, to keep them steddy in their carriages at sea.
These, however, are more properly termed cap-squares. See <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Clamps of the latter sort are likewise frequently used to fasten the
masts or bowsprits of small vessels or boats.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLAWING, or CLAWING-OFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chicaner</span></i>, in navigation, the act of
<i>beating</i> or turning to windward from a lee-shore, so as to acquire a
sufficient distance from it, to escape the dangers of shipwreck, which
often attend so hazardous a situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLEAR, as a naval term, is variously applied to the weather, the sea-coasts,
cordage, navigation, &amp;c. The weather is said to be clear (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fin</span></i>)
when it is fair and open, as opposed to cloudy or foggy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sea-coast is called clear (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saine</span></i>) when the navigation is not interrupted,
or rendered dangerous by rocks, sands, or breakers, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is expressed of cordage, cables, &amp;c. when they are unembarrassed
or disentangled so as to be ready for immediate service. It is usually
opposed to <i>foul</i>, in all those senses.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLEATS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">taquets</span></i>, pieces of wood of different shapes, used occasionally
to fasten ropes upon in a ship: some of them have one, and some
two arms, fig. 17, <i>a</i>, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. others are hollowed in the middle, and
have no arms at all, fig. 17, <i>b</i>: these are nailed to the deck or sides to
fasten any thing to.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLINCH, that part of a cable, or other rope, which is fastened to
the ring of the anchor.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLINCHER-WORK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bordée à quoin</span></i>, the disposition of the planks in
the side of any boat or vessel, when the lower edge of every plank over-lays
the next under it, like the slates on the top of a house.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLOSE-HAULED, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au plus pres</span></i>, the general arrangement
or trim of a ship’s sails, when she endeavours to make a progress
in the nearest direction possible towards that point of the compass from
which the wind bloweth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this manner of sailing the <i>keel</i> commonly makes an angle of six
points with the line of the wind; but sloops, and some other small vessels,
are said to sail almost a point nearer. All vessels, however, are supposed
to make nearly a point of <i>lee-way</i>, when close-hauled, even when
they have the advantage of a good sailing-breeze and smooth water.
The angle of lee-way, however, enlarges in proportion to the increase
of the wind and sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this disposition of the sails, they are all extended sideways on the
ship, so that the wind, as it crosses the ship obliquely toward the stern
from forwards, may fill their cavities. But as the current of wind
also enters the cavities of the sails in an oblique direction, the effort of
it, to make the ship advance, is considerably diminished: she will,
therefore, make the least progress when sailing in this manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ship is said to be close-hauled, because at this time her <i>tacks</i>, or
lower corners of the principal sails, are drawn close down to her
side to windward; the sheets hauled close aft; and all the bow-lines
drawn to their greatest extension, in order to keep the sails steddy.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLOSE-QUARTERS, certain strong barriers of wood stretching
across a merchant-ship in several places. They are used as a place of
retreat when a ship is boarded by her adversary, and are therefore
fitted with several small loop-holes, through which to fire the small arms,
whereby the ship’s crew may defend themselves and annoy the enemy.
They are likewise furnished with several small caissons, called powder-chests,
which are fixed upon the deck, and filled with powder, old nails,
&amp;c. and may be fired at any time from the close-quarters upon the
boarders.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have known an English merchant-ship, of sixteen guns, and
properly fitted with close-quarters, defeat the united efforts of three
French privateers who boarded her in the late war, after having engaged
at some distance nearly a day and a half with very few intervals
of rest. Two of the cruisers were equipped with twelve guns each,
and the other with eight. The French sailors were, after boarding,
so much exposed to the continued fire of musquetry, and coehorns
charged with granadoes, that a dreadful scene of carnage ensued, in
which the decks were soon covered with the dead bodies of the enemy,
several of which the boarders, in their hurry to escape, had left behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>CLUE <i>of a sail</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point</span></i>, the lower corner, and hence</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Clue-Garnets</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cargues point</span></i>, are a sort of tackles fastened to the
<i>clues</i>, or lower corners of the mainsail and foresail, to truss them up
to the yard as occasion requires, which is usually termed <i>clueing-up</i> the
sails.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Clue-Lines</span> are for the same purpose as clue-garnets, only that the
latter are confined to the courses, whereas the clue-lines are common to
all the square sails. See these ropes, as represented in the article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>COACH, or COUCH, a sort of chamber or apartment in a large ship
of war near the <i>stern</i>. The floor of it is formed by the aftmost part of
the quarter-deck, and the roof of it by the poop: it is generally the
habitation of the captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>COAMINGS <i>of the hatches</i>, certain raised borders about the edge of
the hatches of a ship, to prevent the water which may flow in upon the
deck at sea, from running down into the lower apartments. They are
represented in the <span class='sc'>Deck</span>, plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. as enclosing their respective hatchways.</p>

<p class='c008'>COASTING, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aller terre à terre</span></i>, the act of making
a progress along the sea-coast of any country. The principal articles
relating to this part of navigation are, the observing the time
and direction of the tide; knowledge of the reigning winds; of the
roads and havens; of the different depths of the water, and qualities of
the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>COASTING-PILOT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotier</span></i>, a pilot, who by long experience has become
sufficiently acquainted with the nature of any particular coast, and
of the requisites mentioned in the preceding article, to conduct a ship
or fleet from one part of it to another.</p>

<p class='c008'>COAT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">braye</span></i>, a piece of tarred canvas nailed round that part of the
masts and bowsprit which joins to the deck, or lies over the stem of a
ship. It is used to prevent the water from running down into the hold,
or between the decks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides those above mentioned, there is a coat for the rudder nailed
round the hole where the rudder traverses in the ship’s counter. This
hole is represented at the upper part of the stern-post, exhibited in
plate <a href='#X'>X</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Coat</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suage</span></i>, also implies the materials or <i>stuff</i> with which the ship’s
sides or masts are varnished, to preserve them from the sun and weather,
as turpentine, tar, &amp;c. In this sense we say, “Give her a good coat of
tar.”</p>

<p class='c008'>COBBING, a punishment sometimes inflicted at sea. It is performed by
striking the offender a certain number of times on the breech with a flat
piece of wood called the cobbing-board. It is chiefly used as a punishment
to those who quit their station during the period of the night-watch.</p>

<p class='c008'>COBOOSE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fogone</span></i> (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">kambuis</span></i>, Dutch), a sort of box or house to cover the
chimney of some merchant-ships. It is somewhat resembling a centry-box,
and generally stands against the barricade on the fore part of the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>COCK-PIT <i>of a ship of war</i>, the apartments of the surgeon and his
mates, being the place where the wounded men are dressed in the time
of battle, or otherwise. It is situated under the lower-deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>COCKSWAIN, or COXEN, the officer who manages and steers a
boat, and has the command of the boat’s crew. It is evidently compounded
of the words <i>cock</i> and <i>swain</i>, the former of which was anciently
used for a yawl or small boat, as appears by several authors<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a>;
but it has now become obsolete, and is never used by our mariners.</p>

<p class='c008'>COIL, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cueillir</span></i>, Fr.) the manner in which all ropes are disposed aboard
ships for the conveniency of stowage, because</p>

<p class='c008'>COILING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouer</span></i>, implies a sort of serpentine winding of a cable or
other rope, that it may occupy a small space in the ship. Each of the
windings of this sort is called a <i>fake</i>, and one range of fakes upon the
same line is called a <i>tier</i>; there are generally from five to seven fakes
in a tier; and three or four tiers in the whole length of the cable. This,
however, depends on the extent of the fakes. The smaller ropes employed
about the sails are coiled upon <i>cleats</i> at sea, to prevent their
being entangled amongst one another in traversing, contracting, or extending
the sails.</p>

<p class='c008'>COLLAR, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">collier d’ etai</span></i>, a name given to the lower part of any of the
principal stays of the masts, or the part by which the stay is confined
at its lower end. Thus the collar of the main-stay connects the lower
end of the stay to the ship’s stem. See the article <span class='sc'>Stay</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>COLOURS, the flags or banners which distinguish the ships of different
nations. See the articles <span class='sc'>Ensign</span>, <span class='sc'>Jack</span>, and <span class='sc'>Pendant</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>COLLIERS, certain vessels employed to carry coals from one port to
another, chiefly from the northern parts of England to the capital, and
more southerly parts, as well as to foreign markets. This trade is
known to be an excellent nursery for seamen, although they are often
found, from the constitution of their climate, to be not so well calculated
for southern navigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>COMMAND, in the royal navy, implies the rank and power of an
officer who has the management of a ship of war, of whatever kind,
under twenty guns, as sloops of war, armed ships, or bomb-vessels. He
is intitled <i>master</i> and <i>commander</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capitaine du petit état</span></i>, and ranks with a
major in the king’s army.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Commander</span> is also expressed of a large wooden mallet used on sundry
occasions in a ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>COMMISSIONERS <i>of the navy</i>, certain officers appointed to superintend
the affairs of the marine, under the direction of the lord-high-admiral,
or lords commissioners of the admiralty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duty of these officers does not extend to the internal government
of ships invested with a military command, either at sea or in the
port. It is more immediately concerned in the building, docking, repairing,
and cleaning of ships in the dock-yards. In consideration of
this, all ships of war are commissioned from a report of their qualities
presented to the Admiralty by the Navy-board.</p>

<p class='c008'>They have also the appointment of some of the inferior sea-officers,
as surgeons, and masters of ships.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal officers and commissioners residing at the board are,
1, The comptroller. 2, Two surveyors, who are shipwrights. 3, Clerk
of the acts. 4. Comptroller of the treasurer’s accounts. 5. Comptroller
of the victualling accounts. 6. Comptroller of the store-keeper’s accounts.
7. An extraordinary commissioner. Besides these, there are three resident
commissioners, who manage the affairs of the <i>dock-yards</i> at Chatham,
Portsmouth, and Plymouth, under the direction of the board at
the Navy-office.</p>

<p class='c008'>COMMODORE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’ escadre</span></i>, a general officer in the British marine,
invested with the command of a detachment of ships of war destined
on any particular enterprise; during which time he bears the rank of
brigadier-general in the army, and is distinguished from the inferior
ships of his squadron by a broad red pendant tapering towards the
outer-end, and sometimes forked. The word is corrupted from the
Spanish <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">comendador</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Commodore</i> is also a name given to some select ship in a fleet of
merchantmen, who leads the van in time of war, and carries a light
in his top, to conduct the rest and keep them together.</p>

<p class='c008'>COMPANION, a sort of wooden porch placed over the entrance or
stair case of the master’s cabin in a merchant-ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>COMPANY, the whole crew of any ship, including her officers.</p>

<p class='c008'>COMPASS, an instrument employed to determine the ship’s course
at sea, and consisting of a card and two boxes. The card, which is calculated
to represent the horizon, is a circle divided into thirty-two
equal parts, by lines drawn from the center to the circumference,
called points or rumbs. The intervals between the points are also subdivided
into equal parts called degrees, 360 of which complete the
circle; and consequently the distance or angle comprehended between
any two rumbs is equal to 11°, 15´ The four principal rumbs are
called the <i>cardinal points</i>, deriving their names from the places to
which they tend; viz. the two which extend themselves under the
meridian, opposite to each other, pointing to the north and south,
are called the <i>north</i> and <i>south</i> points. That which is towards the right
hand as we look north is termed <i>east</i>, and its opposite the <i>west</i> point.
The names of all the inferior ones are compounded of these, according
to their situation. Along the north and south-line is fixed a steel
needle, which being touched by the load-stone acquires a certain virtue
that makes it hang nearly in the plane of the meridian, and consequently
determine the direction of the other points toward the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The compass being of the utmost importance to the purposes of navigation,
it is reasonable to expect that the greatest attention should
be used in its construction, and every attempt to improve it carefully
examined, and adopted, if proper. Great errors and irregularities,
however, have been found incident to the construction of common
compasses, arising from the shape of their needles, by which they have
not only turned from the true direction, but from that of each other<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.
To remedy these inconveniencies, the learned Dr. Knight was induced
to contrive a new sea-compass, which is now used aboard all our vessels
of war<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a>. The needles of the other instruments were generally composed
of two pieces of steel wire, bent in the middle, and approaching
each other towards the ends, where they met. Others were made of
one piece of steel of a spring temper, and broad towards the ends, but
tapering towards the middle; but the needle in Dr. Knight’s compass
is quite straight, and square at the ends, and consequently has only two
poles, although the curves are a little confused about the hole in the
middle. Needles of this construction, after vibrating a long time, will
always point exactly in the same direction; and if drawn ever so little
on one side, will return to it again, without any sensible difference.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to illustrate the above description, we have exhibited a
view of the several parts of the compass, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. where fig. 19, is the
card, with the needle N S, and its cap fixed upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 21, is the pedestal that supports the card, containing a sewing
needle fixed in two small grooves to receive it, by means of a collet C,
in the manner of a port crayon. D, the stem, is filed into an octogon,
that it may the more easily be unscrewed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A B, fig. 20, is the box in which the compass hangs in the binacle.</p>

<p class='c008'>C D, is the ring that supports the inner box.</p>

<p class='c008'>E F, is the inner box, which contains the card and needle.</p>

<p class='c008'>G H, one of its axes, by which it is suspended on the ring C D.</p>

<p class='c008'>I, is a place cut out in the wood, serving as an handle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The magnet or needle appears passing though the center, together
with a small brace of ivory that confines the cap to its place.</p>

<p class='c008'>The card is a single varnished paper, reaching as far as the outer circle
of figures, which is a circle of thin brass; the edge whereof is
turned down at right angles to the plane of the card, in order to stiffen
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The compass is retained in the binacle at sea, as exhibited in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.
fig. 6. For the other parts of the compass represented in the figure,
see the article <span class='sc'>Azimuth</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>COMPASSING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devers</span></i>, a name given by shipwrights to such pieces
of timber as are incurvated into the figure of an arch, whether circular,
elliptical, or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>COMPTROLLER <i>of the navy</i>, one of the principal officers of the Navy-board,
at which he presides, to direct the inferior and civil department
of the marine, as the admiralty superintends the superior and military
operations of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>CONVOY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conserve</span></i>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convoyer</span></i>, Fr.) a fleet or navy of merchant-ships
bound on a voyage to some particular part or general rendezvous.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Convoy</span> also implies the ship or ships appointed to conduct and defend
them on their passage thither.</p>

<p class='c008'>CORDAGE, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordage</span></i>, Fr.) a general term for the running <i>rigging</i> of
a ship, or all that part of her rigging which is employed to extend,
contract, or traverse the sails; or which lies in reserve to supply the place
of such as may be rendered unserviceable. See the article <span class='sc'>Rigging</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CORPORAL <i>of a ship of war</i>, an officer under the master at arms,
employed to teach the sailors the exercise of small arms, or musketry;
to attend at the gangway, or entering-ports, and observe that no spirituous
liquors are brought into the ship, unless by particular leave
from the officers. He is also to extinguish the fire and candles at eight
o’clock in winter, and nine in summer, when the evening gun is fired;
and to walk frequently down in the lower decks in his watch, to see
that there are no lights but such as are under the charge of proper
centinels.</p>

<p class='c008'>CORPOSANT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu St. Elme</span></i> (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">corpo santo</span></i>, Ital.), a sort of volatile meteor,
or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</span></i>, often beheld in a dark and tempestuous night about the
decks or rigging of a ship, but particularly at the extremities, as the mast-heads,
and yard arms: it is most frequent in heavy rain, accompanied
with lightning. “They usually wander with uncertain motion from
place to place, sometimes appearing to cleave close to the sails and masts;
but they frequently leap up and down with intermission, affording an
obscure flame, like that of a candle burning faintly. They are produced
by some sulphureous and bituminous matter, which being beat down
by the motion of the air above, and gathering together, is kindled by
the agitation of the air, as butter is gathered together by the agitation
of the cream. And from this appearance we infer that storms come
from sulphureous spirits that rarify the air, and put it into a motion.”
<cite>Varenius</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CORSAIR, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corsair</span></i>, Fr.) a name commonly given to the piratical
cruisers of Barbary, who frequently plunder the merchant-ships of
European nations with whom they are at peace.</p>

<p class='c008'>COTT, a particular sort of bed-frame, suspended from the beams of a
ship, for the officers to sleep in between the decks. This contrivance is
much more convenient at sea than either the hammocks or fixed cabins,
being a large piece of canvas sewed into the form of a chest, about six
feet long, one foot deep, and from two to three feet wide: it is extended
by a square wooden frame with a canvas bottom, equal to its length
and breadth, to retain it in an horizontal position.</p>

<p class='c008'>COVE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anse</span></i>, a small creek or bay, where boats or little vessels may
ride at anchor sheltered from the wind and sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>COUNTER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre-arcasse</span></i>, an arch or vault whose upper-part is terminated
by the bottom of the <i>stern</i>, and the lower part by the wing-transom
and buttock, being expressed by the letters KG, in the elevation,
plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. as likewise by the same letters in fig. 1, plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. and
the figure referred to from the article <span class='sc'>Quarter</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is also another counter above, parallel to this, but not vaulted;
it extends from the upper-part of the lower, or vaulted counter, to the
moulding which terminates the windows of the cabin or ward-room
below. This latter is usually called the upper or second counter.</p>

<p class='c008'>COUNTER-BRACING. See this operation fully explained in the
article <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>COURSE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">route</span></i>, in navigation, the angle contained between the nearest
meridian and that point of the compass upon which a ship sails in any
particular direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>COURSES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pacfis</span></i>, a name by which the principal sails of a ship are
usually distinguished, viz. the main-sail, fore-sail, and mizen: the
mizen-stay-sail and fore-sail are also sometimes comprehended in this
denomination, as are the main-stay-sails of all brigs and schooners. See
the article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CRAB, a sort of wooden pillar, whose lower end, being let down
through a ship’s decks, rests upon a socket like the capstern; and
having in its upper-end three or four holes, at different heights, thro’
the middle of it, above one another, into which long bars are thrust,
whose length is nearly equal to the breadth of the deck. It is employed
to wind in the cable, or to purchase any other weighty matter
which requires a great mechanical power. This differs from a capstern,
as not being furnished with a <i>drum-head</i>, and by having the bars
to go intirely through it, reaching from one side of the deck to the
other; whereas those of the capstern, which are superior in number,
reach only about eight inches or a foot into the drum-head, according
to the size thereof. This machine is represented in plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. by fig.
10, and 13. See also <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CRADLE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">slee</span></i>, a frame placed under the bottom of a ship, in order to
conduct her smoothly and steddily into the water when she is to be
lanched; at which time it supports her weight whilst she slides down
the descent, or sloping passage called the <i>ways</i>, which are for this purpose
daubed with soap and tallow. This frame is exhibited by fig. 23,
plate <a href='#II'>II</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CRAFT, a general name for all sorts of vessels employed to load or
discharge merchant-ships, or to carry along-side, or return the stores of
men of war: such are lighters, hoys, barges, prames, &amp;c. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>CRANK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coté-foible</span></i>, the quality of a ship, which for want of a sufficient
quantity of <i>ballast</i> or cargo, is rendered incapable of carrying sail without
being exposed to the danger of overturning. See the articles <span class='sc'>Ballast</span>
and <span class='sc'>Trim</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Crank</span>, is also an iron brace which supports the lanthorns on the poop-quarters,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>CRAWL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouchot</span></i>, a sort of pen, or place of confinement, formed by
a barrier of stakes and hurdles on the sea-coast, to contain any sort of
fish within it.</p>

<p class='c008'>CREEPER, an instrument of iron resembling a grappling, having a
<i>shank</i> and four hooks or claws, fig. 24, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. It is used to throw into
the bottom of any river or harbour, with a rope fastened to it, to hook
and draw up any thing from the bottom which may have been lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>CRINGLE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancet</span></i>, a small hole made in the <i>bolt-rope</i> of a sail, by inter-twisting
one of the divisions of a rope, called a <i>strand</i>, alternately round
itself and through the <i>strands</i> of the bolt-rope, till it becomes three-fold,
and assumes the shape of a wreath or ring. See plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 25, where
a, b, represents part of the bolt-rope of a sail; and c, the cringle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use of the cringle is generally to contain the end of some rope,
which is fastened thereto, for the purpose of drawing up the sail to its
yard, or of extending the skirts by the means of <i>bridles</i> to stand upon
a side-wind. The word seems to be derived from <i><span lang="nl-be" xml:lang="nl-be">krinckelen</span></i>, (Belg.) to run
into twists.</p>

<p class='c008'>CROSS-JACK, pronounced <i>crojeck</i>, a sail extended on the lower yard
of the <i>mizen</i>-mast, which is hence called the <i>cross-jack yard</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vergue seche</span></i>.
This sail, however, has generally been found of little service, and is
therefore very seldom used.</p>

<p class='c008'>CROSS PIECE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rasteau</span></i>, a rail of timber extended over the <i>windlass</i>
of a merchant-ship from the knight-heads to the belfry. It is stuck full
of wooden pins, which are used to fasten the running-rigging as occasion
requires. See the article <span class='sc'>Windlass</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CROSS-TREES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barres de hune</span></i>, certain pieces of timber supported by
the <i>cheeks</i> and tressel-trees, at the upper-ends of the lower-masts, athwart
which they are laid, to sustain the frame of the <i>top</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CROTCHES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourcats</span></i>, (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">croccia</span></i>, Ital.) a name given to those crooked
timbers that are placed upon the keel in the fore and hind-parts of a
ship, upon which the frame of her hull grows narrower below, as it
approaches the stern afore, and the stern-post abaft.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Crotches</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cornes</span></i>, are also certain pieces of wood or iron, whose upper
part opens into two horns or arms, like a half-moon. They are fixed
in different places of the ship, according to the uses for which they may
be designed, which is usually to support the spare-masts, yards, &amp;c. The
iron crotches are exhibited in plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 26.</p>

<p class='c008'>CROW, an iron lever well known in mechanics, and furnished with
a sharp point at one end, and two claws at the other, as appears in fig.
27, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>This instrument is used for various purposes, by shipwrights and mariners;
as to remove pieces of timber, and other weighty bodies; and to
draw spike-nails, &amp;c. as well as to manage the great guns, by moving
them into their ports, levelling or pointing them to a particular object.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> CROWD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forcer de voiles</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cruth</span></i>, Sax.) to carry an extraordinary
force of sail upon a ship, in order to accelerate her course on some important
occasion, as in pursuit of, or flight from, an enemy; to escape
any immediate danger, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>CROW-FOOT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trelingage</span></i>, a complication of small cords spreading
out from a long block, like the smaller parts which extend from the
back-bone of a herring. See plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 27. It is used to suspend the
<i>awnings</i>; or to keep the <i>top-sails</i> from striking violently and fretting
against the edges of the tops.</p>

<p class='c008'>CROWNING, the finishing part of a knot made on the end of a rope.
It is performed by interweaving the ends of the different brands artfully
amongst each other, so as that they may not become loosened or
untwisted. The design of these knots is to keep the end of the rope
fast in some place assigned for it: they are more particularly useful in
all kinds of stoppers.</p>

<p class='c008'>CRUISE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">campaigne</span></i> (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croiser</span></i>, Fr.), a voyage or expedition in quest of
vessels or fleets of the enemy, which may be expected to sail through
any particular tract of the sea at a certain season of the year. The
region in which these cruises are performed, is usually termed the rendezvous
or cruising-latitude. When the ships employed for this purpose,
which are accordingly called cruisers, have arrived at their destined
station, they traverse the sea backward and forward, under an easy
sail, and within a limited space, conjectured to be nearly in the tract of
their expected adversaries.</p>

<p class='c008'>CUDDY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coqueron</span></i>, a sort of cabin, or cook-room, in the fore-part, or
near the stern, of a lighter or barge of burden.</p>

<p class='c008'>CUNNING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire gouverner</span></i>, the art of directing the steersman to guide
the ship in her proper course: the officer who performs this duty is
either the pilot or quarter-master.</p>

<p class='c008'>CURRENT, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courans</span></i>, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">currens</span></i>, Lat.) a certain progressive
movement of the water of the sea, by which all bodies floating
therein are compelled to alter their course, or velocity, or both, and
submit to the laws imposed on them by the current.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sea, currents are either natural and general, as arising from the
diurnal rotation of the earth about its axis; or accidental and particular,
caused by the waters being driven against promontories, or into
gulfs and streights; where, wanting room to spread, they are driven
back, and thus disturb the ordinary flux of the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Currents are various, and directed towards different parts of the
ocean, of which some are constant, and others periodical. The most
extraordinary current of the sea is that by which part of the Atlantic
or African ocean moves about Guinea from Cape Verd towards the
curvature or bay of Africa, which they call Fernando Poo, viz. from
west to east, contrary to the general motion. And such is the force of
this current, that when ships approach too near the shore, it carries
them violently towards that bay, and deceives the mariners in their
reckoning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is a great variety of shifting currents, which do not last, but
return at certain periods; and these do, most of them, depend upon,
and follow the anniversary winds or monsoons, which by blowing in
one place may cause a current in another<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.” <cite>Varenius.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>In the streights of Gibraltar the currents almost constantly drive to
the eastward, and carry ships into the Mediterranean: they are also
found to drive the same way into St. George’s-channel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The setting, or progressive motion of the current, may be either quite
down to the bottom, or to a certain determinate depth.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the knowledge of the direction and velocity of currents is a very
material article in navigation, it is highly necessary to discover both, in
order to ascertain the ship’s situation and course with as much accuracy
as possible. The most successful method which has been hitherto attempted
by mariners for this purpose, is as follows. A common iron
pot, which may contain four or five gallons, is suspended by a small rope
fastened to its ears or handles, so as to hang directly upright, as when
placed upon the fire. This rope, which may be from 70 to 100 fathoms
in length, being prepared for the experiment, is coiled in the boat,
which is hoisted out of the ship at a proper opportunity, when there is
little or no wind to ruffle the surface of the sea. The pot being then
thrown overboard into the water, and immediately sinking, the line is
slackened till about seventy or eighty fathoms run out, after which the
line is fastened to the boat’s stem, by which she is accordingly restrained,
and rides as at anchor. The velocity of the current is then easily
tried by the <i>log</i> and half-minute glass, the usual method of discovering
the rate of a ship’s sailing at sea. The course of the stream is next
obtained by means of the compass provided for this operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having thus found the setting and drift of the current, it remains
to apply this experiment to the purposes of navigation. If the ship
sails along the direction of the current, then the motion of the ship is
increased by as much as is the drift or velocity of the current.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a current sets directly against the ship’s course, then her motion is
retarded in proportion to the strength of the current. Hence it is plain,</p>

<p class='c008'>1.  If the velocity of the current be less than that of the ship, then
the ship will advance so much as is the difference of these velocities.</p>

<p class='c008'>2.  If the velocity of the current be more than that of the ship, then
will the ship fall as much <i>astern</i> as is the difference of these velocities.</p>

<p class='c008'>3.  If the velocity of the current be equal to that of the ship, then
will the ship stand still, the one velocity destroying the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the current thwarts the course of a ship, it not only diminishes or
increases her velocity, but gives her a new direction, compounded of the
course she steers, and the setting of the current, as appears by the following</p>

<h4 class='c014'>LEMMA.</h4>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_104.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>If a body at A be impelled by
two forces at the same time, the
one in the direction A B, carrying
it from A to B in a certain
space of time, and the other in the
direction A D, pushing it from A
to D in the same time; complete
the parallelogram ABCD, and
draw the diagonal A C: then the body at A, (which let us suppose a
ship agitated by the wind and current; A B, being the line along which
she advances as impressed by the wind, and A D the line upon which
she is driven by the current) will move along the diagonal A C, and
will be in the point C, at the end of the time in which it would have
moved along A D or AB, as impelled by either of those forces (the wind
or current) separately.</p>

<p class='c008'>CUTTER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bateau</span></i>, a small vessel commonly navigated in the channel
of England; it is furnished with one mast, and rigged as a <i>sloop</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of these vessels are used on an illicit trade, and others employed
by the government to seize them; the latter of which are either under
the direction of the Admiralty or Custom-house. See a representation
of a cutter of this sort in the plate referred to from the article <span class='sc'>Vessel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>CUTTING-DOWN <span class='sc'>Line</span>, a curved line used by shipwrights in the
delineation of ships: it determines the thickness of all the floor timbers,
and likewise the height of the <i>dead-wood</i>, <i>afore</i> and <i>abaft</i>. It is limited
in the middle of the ship by the thickness of the floor-timber, and
abaft by the breadth of the <i>kelson</i>; and must be carried up so high upon
the stem, as to leave sufficient substance for the breeches of the rising
timbers. <cite>Murray’s Ship-building.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>CUT-WATER, the foremost part of a ship’s prow, formed of an assemblage
of several pieces of timber, to render it broad at the upper-part,
where it projects forward from the stem to open the column of
water as the ship sails along, and also to make her keep to windward
better, when she is close-hauled. It is otherwise called the knee of the
head. See the article <span class='sc'>Stem</span>; as also the several parts of it represented
in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>D.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Davit, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">minot</span></i>, a long beam of timber, represented by a, a, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig.
28, and used as a crane, whereby to hoist the flukes of the anchor
to the top of the <i>bow</i>, without injuring the planks of the ship’s side as
it ascends; an operation which by mariners is called fishing the anchor.
The anchors being situated on both the bows, the davit may be occasionally
shifted so as to project over either side of the ship, according to
the position of that anchor on which it is to be employed. The inner-end
of the davit is secured by being thrust into a square ring of iron b, which
is bolted to the deck, and fore-locked under the beams. This ring,
which is called the span-shackle, exhibited at large by fig. 34, is fixed
exactly in the middle of the deck, and close behind the fore-mast.
Upon the outer-end of the davit is hung a large block c, through which
a strong rope traverses, called the fish-pendant d, to whose foremost
end is fitted a large iron hook e, and to its after end a tackle or complication
of pullies f, the former of which is called the fish-hook, and
the latter the fish-tackle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The davit therefore, according to the sea-phrase, is employed to
<i>fish the anchor</i>, which being previously <i>catted</i>, the fish-hook is fastened
upon its flukes; and the effort of the tackle, being transmitted to the
hook by means of the fish-pendant, draws up that part of the anchor
sufficiently high upon the bow to fasten it, which is done by the
<i>Shank-painter</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is also a davit of a smaller kind, occasionally fixed in the longboat,
and employed to weigh the anchor therein.</p>

<p class='c008'>DAY’S-WORK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cinglage</span></i>, the reckoning or account of the ship’s course,
during twenty-four hours, or between noon and noon, according to the
rules of trigonometry. See <span class='sc'>Dead-Reckoning</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEAD-EYE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap de mouton</span></i>, a sort of round, flattish, wooden block,
see fig. 30, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. It is usually encircled with the end of a rope, or with
an iron band, fig. 31, <i>b</i>, and pierced with three holes through the flat, in
order to receive the rope called a <i>laniard c</i>, which corresponding with
three holes in another dead-eye <i>a</i>, creates a purchase employed for various
uses, but chiefly to extend the <i>shrouds</i> and <i>stays</i>, otherwise called the
standing-rigging.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to form this purchase, one of the dead-eyes is fastened in the
lower-end of each shroud, and the opposite one in the upper-link of
each <i>chain</i> on the ship’s side, which is made round to receive and encompass
the hollowed outer-edge of the dead-eye. After this the
laniard is passed alternately through the holes in the upper and lower
dead-eyes till it becomes six-fold; and is then drawn tight by the application
of mechanical powers. The general disposition of the dead eyes
in their channels is represented in the Elevation, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. In merchant-ships
they are generally fitted with iron plates in the room of chains.
These last are exhibited in fig. 16, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dead-eyes used for the stays, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moques</span></i>, have only one hole, which,
however, is large enough to receive ten or twelve turns of the laniard:
these are generally termed <i>hearts</i>, and are expressed by fig. 32.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are also dead-eyes of another form, employed for the <i>crow-feet</i>,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moques de trelingage</span></i>. These are long cylindrical blocks, fig. 33, with a
number of small holes in them, to receive the legs or lines of which the
crow-foot, fig. 28, is composed.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEAD-LIGHTS, certain wooden ports which are made to fasten into
the cabin-windows, to prevent the waves from gushing into the ship in a
high sea. As they are made exactly to fit the windows, and are strong
enough to resist the waves, they are always fixed in, on the approach of
a storm, and the glass frames taken out, which might other wise be
shattered to pieces by the surges, and suffer great quantities of water to
enter the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEAD-RECKONING, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estime</span></i>, the judgment or estimation
which is made of the place where a ship is situated, without any observation
of the heavenly bodies. It is discovered by keeping an account
of the distance she has run by the <i>log</i>, and of her course steered by the
<i>compass</i>; and by rectifying these data by the usual allowances for <i>drift</i>,
<i>lee-way</i>, &amp;c. according to the ship’s known trim. This reckoning, however,
is always to be corrected, as often as any good observation of the
sun can be obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEAD-RISING, or RISING-LINE <i>of the floor</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs</span></i>, those parts of a
ship’s floor, or bottom, throughout her whole length, where the floor-timber
is terminated upon the lower futtock. See the article <span class='sc'>Naval
Architecture</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEAD-WATER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">remoux</span></i> the eddy of water which appears like little
whirl-pools, closing in with the ship’s stern as she sails through it.<a id='Water'></a></p>

<p class='c008'>DEAD-WOOD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre-quille</span></i>, a name given by shipwrights to certain
blocks of timber laid upon the keel, particularly at the extremities afore
and abaft, where these pieces are placed one upon another to a considerable
height, because the ship is there so narrow as not to admit of the two
half timbers, which are therefore scored into this dead wood, where the
angle of the floor-timbers gradually diminishes, as approaching the stem
and stern-post. See the article <span class='sc'>Naval Architecture</span>.<a id='Wood'></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In the fore-part of the ship, the dead-wood generally extends from
the stemson, upon which it is scarfed to the loof-frame; and in the
after-end from the stern-post, where it is confined by the knee, to the
after-ballance-frame. It is connected to the keel by strong spike-nails.
Those pieces are represented by e e, <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span>, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dead-wood afore and abaft is equal in depth to two-thirds of the
depth of the keel, and as broad as can be procured, so as not to exceed
the breadth of the keel.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEAD-WORK, all that part of a ship which is above water when
she is laden. See the article <span class='sc'>Upper-Work</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DECKS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ponts</span></i>, (<i><span lang="da" xml:lang="da">decken</span></i>, Dan. to cover) the planked floors of a ship,
which connect the sides together, and serve as different platforms to
support the artillery, and lodge the men, as also to preserve the cargo
from the sea in merchant-vessels.</p>

<p class='c008'>As all ships are broader at the lower-deck than on the next above it,
and as the cannon thereof are always heaviest, it is necessary that the
frame of it should be much stronger than that of the others; and, for the
same reason, the second or middle deck ought to be stronger than
the upper deck, or forecastle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ships of the first and second rates are furnished with three whole decks,
reaching from the stem to the stern, besides a forecastle and a quarterdeck,
which extends from the stern to the main-mast, between which and
the fore-castle, a vacancy is left in the middle, opening to the upper-deck,
and forming what is called the <i>waist</i>. There is yet another deck
above the hinder or aftmost part of the quarter-deck, called the poop,
which also serves as a roof for the captain’s cabin or couch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The inferior ships of the line of battle are equipped with two decks
and a half, and frigates, sloops, &amp;c. with one gun-deck and a half,
with a spar deck below to lodge the crew.</p>

<p class='c008'>The decks are formed and sustained by the beams, the clamps, the
water-ways, the carlings, the ledges, the knees, and two rows of small
pillars, called stanchions, &amp;c. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the figure of a deck, together with its corresponding parts, may
be more clearly understood, we have exhibited a plan of the lower-deck
of a 74 gun-ship in plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. And as both sides of the deck are exactly
similar, the pieces by which it is supported appear on one side, and
on the other side the planks or floor of which it is composed, as laid

<p class='c008'>S, the breast-hook of the gun-deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>T T, the station of the chain-pumps.</p>

<p class='c008'>V, the breadth and thickness of the timbers at the height of the
gun-deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>U U, scuttles leading to the gunner’s store-room, and bread-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>W, the station of the fore-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>X, the station of the main-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Y, the station of the mizen-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Z, the ring-bolts of the decks, used to retain the cannon whilst
charging.</p>

<p class='c008'>a, a, the ring-bolts of the sides, whereon the tackles are hooked that
secure the cannon at sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>c a a d, the water-ways, through which the scupper-holes are pierced,
to carry the water off from the deck into the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>b, b, plan of the foremost and aftmost cable-bits, with their crosspieces
g, g, and their standards e, e.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus we have represented on one side, all the pieces which sustain
the deck with its cannon; and on the other side, the deck itself, with
a tier of 32 pounders planted in battery thereon. In order also to
shew the use of the breeching and train-tackle, one of the guns is
drawn in as ready for charging. See the articles <span class='sc'>Breeching</span> and <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of beams, by which the decks of ships are supported, is
often very different, according to the practice of different countries; the
strength of the timber of which the beams are framed; and the services
for which the ship is calculated.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the deck which contains the train of a fire-ship is furnished with an
equipage peculiar to itself, the whole apparatus is particularly described
in the article <span class='sc'>Fire-ship</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Flush</i>-<span class='sc'>Deck</span>, or <span class='sc'>Deck</span>-<i>Flush fore and aft</i>, implies a continued floor laid
from stem to stern, upon one line, without any steps or intervals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Half</i>-<span class='sc'>Deck</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de garde</span></i>, a space under the quarter-deck of a ship
of war, contained between the foremost bulk-head of the <i>steerage</i>, and
the fore-part of the quarter-deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the colliers of Northumberland the steerage itself is called the half-deck,
and is usually the habitation of the ship’s crew.</p>

<p class='c008'>DECOY, a stratagem employed by a small ship of war to betray a
vessel of inferior force into an incautious pursuit, till she has drawn her
within the range of her cannon, or what is called within gun-shot.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usually performed by painting the stern and sides in such a manner
as to disguise the ship, and represent her either much smaller, and
of inferior force, or as a friend to the hostile vessel, which she endeavours
to ensnare, by assuming the emblems and ornaments of the nation
to which the stranger is supposed to belong. When she has thus provoked
the adversary to chase, in hope of acquiring a prize, she continues
the decoy by spreading a great sail, as endeavouring to escape, at the
same time that her course is considerably retarded by an artful alteration,
of her <i>trim</i> till the enemy approaches.</p>

<p class='c008'>Decoying is also performed to elude the chace of a ship of superior
force in a dark night, by throwing out a lighted cask of pitch into the
sea, which will burn for a considerable time, and misguide the enemy.
Immediately after the cask is thrown out, the ship changes her course,
and may easily escape if at any tolerable distance from the foe.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEEP-WAISTED, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encastillé</span></i>, the distinguishing fabric of a ship’s
decks, when the quarter-deck and fore-castle are elevated from four to
six feet above the level of the upper-deck, so as to leave a vacant space,
called the waiste, on the middle of the upper-deck. See the article
<span class='sc'>Waiste</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEMURRAGE, an allowance given to the commander of a trading
ship by the merchants, for having detained him longer in port than
the time previously appointed for his departure.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEPARTURE, in navigation, the distance between any two places
lying on the same parallel, counted in miles of the equator; or the distance
of one place from the meridian of another, counted on the parallel
passing over that place. See <span class='sc'>Navigation</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DEPTH <i>of a sail</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chute</span></i>, the extent of any square or oblong sail from
the head-rope to the foot-rope; or the length of the after-leech of any
boom-sail or stay-sail. See the article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DETACHMENT <i>of a fleet or squadron</i>, a certain number of ships
chosen by an admiral or commodore from the rest of the fleet, charged
to execute some particular service.</p>

<p class='c008'>DIFFERENCE <i>of latitude</i>, in navigation, the difference between any
two places lying on the same meridian; or the distance between the
parallels of latitude of any two places, expressed in miles of the equator.</p>

<p class='c008'>DINNAGE, see the article <span class='sc'>Dunnage</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DISABLED, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">desemparé</span></i>, the state of a ship when, by the loss of her masts,
sails, yards, or rigging; by springing a leak, or receiving some fracture
in her hull, or other disaster; she is rendered incapable of prosecuting
her voyage without great difficulty and danger.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> DISCHARGE, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">decharger</span></i>, Fr.) when applied to a ship, signifies to
unlade her, or take out her stores, ammunition, artillery, &amp;c. When
expressed of the officers or crew, it implies to disband them from immediate
service.</p>

<p class='c008'>DISMASTED, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dematé</span></i>, the state of a ship which has lost her masts by
boisterous weather, engagement, or other misfortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>DIVISION, a select number of ships in a fleet or squadron of men
of war, distinguished by a particular flag or pendant, and usually commanded
by a general officer. A squadron is commonly ranged into
three divisions, the commanding officer of which is always stationed in
the center.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a fleet consists of sixty sail of the <i>line</i>, that is, of ships having
at least sixty cannon, the admiral divides it into three squadrons, each
of which has its divisions and commanding officers. Each squadron has
its proper colours, according to the rank of the admiral who commands
it, and every division its proper mast. Thus, the white flag denotes
the first squadron of France; the white and blue the second, and the
third is characterised by the blue. In England, the first admiral, or
the admiral of the fleet, displays the union flag at the main-top-mast-head;
next follows the white flag with St. George’s cross; and afterwards
the blue. The private ships carry pendants of the same colour
with their respective squadron, at the masts of their particular divisions;
so that the last ship in the division of the blue squadron carries
a blue pendant at her mizen-top-mast-head.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOCK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forme</span></i>, (imagined of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοχεῖον</span>) a sort of broad and deep trench,
formed on the side of a harbour, or on the banks of a river; and commodiously
fitted either to build ships, or receive them to be repaired
and <i>breamed</i> therein. These sorts of docks have generally strong flood-gates,
to prevent the flux of the tide from entering the dock while the
ship is under repair.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are likewise docks of another kind, called wet-docks, where
a ship can only be cleaned during the recess of the tide, or in the interval
between the time when the tide left her dry a-ground, and the period
when it again reaches her by the return of the flood. Docks of
the latter kind are not furnished with the usual flood-gates.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOCKING <i>a ship</i>, the act of drawing her into the dock, in order to
give her a proper repair, and cleanse the bottom, and cover it anew
with a preparation of stuff, as explained in the article <span class='sc'>Breaming</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOCK-YARDS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arcenaux</span></i>, certain magazines containing all sorts of
naval stores, and timber for ship-building. In England, the royal dock-yards
are at Chatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Deptford, Woolwich,
and Sheerness. His majesty’s ships and vessels of war are generally
moored at these ports, during the time of peace; and such as want repairing
are taken into the docks, examined, and refitted for service.
See the article <span class='sc'>Repair</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal dock-yards are governed by a commissioner, resident
at the port, who superintends all the musters of the officers, artificers,
and labourers, employed in the dock-yard, and ordinary. He also
controls their payment therein; examines the accounts; contracts, and
draws bills on the Navy-office to supply the deficiency of stores; and,
finally, regulates whatever belongs to the dock-yard, maintaining due
order in the respective offices.</p>

<p class='c008'>These yards are generally supplied from the northern crowns with
hemp, pitch, tar, rosin, canvas, oak plank, and several other species.
With regard to the masts, particularly those of the largest size, they
are usually imported from New-England.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOG, a sort of iron hook, or bar, with a sharp fang at one end, so
formed as to be easily driven into a plank: it is used to drag along the
planks of oak when they are let into a hole under the stern of a ship,
to be stowed in the <i>hold</i>. For this purpose there is a rope fastened to
the end of the dog, upon which several men pull, to draw the plank
towards the place where it is to be stowed. It is also used for the
same purpose in unlading the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOGGER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dogre-bot</span></i>, a Dutch fishing-vessel navigated in the German
ocean. It is generally employed in the herring fishery, being equipped
with two masts, viz. a main-mast and a mizen-mast, and somewhat resembling
<i>a ketch</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOLPHIN <i>of the mast</i> a peculiar kind of wreath, formed of platted
cordage, to be fastened occasionally round the masts, as a support to
the <i>puddening</i>, whose use is to sustain the weight of the fore and main-yards,
in case the rigging, or chains, by which those yards are suspended,
should be shot away in the time of battle; a circumstance
which might render their sails useless at a season when their assistance
is extremely necessary. See the article <span class='sc'>Puddening</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOUBLING, in navigation, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doubler</span></i>, Fr.) the act of sailing round, or
passing beyond a cape or promontory, so as that the cape or point of
land separates the ship from her former situation, or lies between her
and any distant observer.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOUBLING-NAILS, amongst shipwrights, the nails commonly used
to fasten the lining of the gun-ports, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOUBLING-UPON, in a naval engagement, the act of enclosing
any part of a hostile fleet between two fires, or of cannonading it on
both sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usually performed by the van or rear of that fleet which is superior
in number, taking the advantage of the wind, or of its situation
and circumstances, and tacking or veering round the van or rear
of the enemy, who will thereby be exposed to great danger, and can
scarcely avoid being thrown into a general confusion.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> DOUSE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">molir</span></i>, to lower suddenly or slacken: expressed of a sail in
a squall of wind, an extended hawser, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>DOWN-HAWL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calebas</span></i>, a rope passing up along a stay through the
rings of the stay-sail, and tied to the upper-corner of the sail, to pull it
down, when they are <i>shortening</i> sail.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Down-haul-Tackle</span>, a complication of pullies, employed to pull
down the main or fore-yard in a tempest, in order to reef the sail.
It is used at this time, because the violence of the wind prevents the
weight of the yard from having its natural effect, of descending, when
the ropes by which it is suspended are slackened.</p>

<p class='c008'>DRABLER, an additional part of a sail, sometimes laced to the
bottom of the <i>bonnet</i> of a <i>square-sail</i>, in sloops and schooners.</p>

<p class='c008'>DRAG, a machine consisting of a sharp square iron ring encircled
with a net, and commonly used to rake the mud off from the platform
or bottom of the docks. See plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. fig. 35.</p>

<p class='c008'>DRAGGING <i>the anchor</i>, the act of trailing it along the bottom, after
it is loosened from the ground, by the effort of the wind or current
upon the ship, communicated to the cable. See the article <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>DRAUGHT, the depth of a body of water necessary to float a ship;
hence a ship is said to draw so many feet of water, when she is borne
up by a column of water of that particular depth. Thus, if it requires
a body of water whose depth is equal to twelve feet, to float
or buoy up a ship on its surface, she is said to draw twelve feet water;
and that this draught may be more readily known, the feet are
marked on the stem and stern-post, regularly from the keel upwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>DRESSING, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire la parade</span></i>), the act of ornamenting a ship with a
variety of colours; as ensigns, flags, pendants, &amp;c. displayed from different
parts of her masts and rigging on a day of festivity.</p>

<p class='c008'>DRIFT, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">derive</span></i> (from <i>drive</i>), the angle which the line
of a ship’s motion makes with the nearest meridian, when she drives
with her side to the wind and waves, and is not governed by the
power of the helm: it also implies the distance which the ship drives on
that line.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship’s way is only called drift in a storm; and then, when it blows
so vehemently, as to prevent her from carrying any sail, or at least
restrains her to such a portion of sail as may be necessary to keep her
sufficiently inclined to one side, that she may not be dismasted by her
violent labouring produced by the turbulence of the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>DRIVER, an oblong sail, occasionally hoisted to the mizen-peak,
when the wind is very fair. The lower corners of it are extended by
a <i>boom</i> or pole, which is thrust out across the ship, and projects over the
lee-quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'>DRIVING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abattre</span></i> (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">drifan</span></i>, Sax.) the state of being carried at random
along the surface of the water, as impelled by a storm, or impetuous
current: it is generally expressed of a ship when, accidentally, broke
loose from her anchors or moorings.</p>

<p class='c008'>DROP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etarcure</span></i>, a name sometimes given to the depth of the principal
sails; as, her main-top-sail <i>drops</i> seventeen yards.</p>

<p class='c008'>DUCKING, a sort of marine punishment inflicted by the French on
those who have been convicted of desertion, blasphemy, or exciting
sedition. It is performed as follows: the criminal is placed astride of
a short thick batten, fastened to the end of a rope, which passes thro’ a
block hanging at one of the yard-arms. Thus fixed, he is hoisted suddenly
up to the yard, and the rope being slackened at once, he is
plunged into the sea. This chastisement is repeated several times, conformable
to the purport of the sentence pronounced against the culprit,
who has at that time several cannon-shot fastened to his feet during
the punishment, which is rendered public by the firing of a gun, to
advertise the other ships of the fleet thereof, that their crews may become
spectators. <cite>Aubin.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ducking</span>, is also a penalty which veteran sailors pretend to inflict
on those, who, for the first time, pass the tropic of Cancer, the Equator,
or the streights of Gibraltar, in consequence of their refusal or incapacity
to pay the usual fine levied on this occasion, which would redeem
them from the said penalty.</p>

<p class='c008'>DUNNAGE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fardage</span></i>, a quantity of faggots, boughs of trees, or
other loose wood, laid in the bottom of a ship, either to raise the heavy
goods which might make her too stiff, or to keep the cargo sufficiently
above the bottom, that it may sustain no damage from the water, if the
ship should prove leaky.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>E.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>EARINGS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rabans</span></i>, certain small cords employed to fasten the upper
corners of a sail to its respective yard; for which purpose one end
of the earing is spliced to the <i>cringle</i>, fixed in that part of the<a id='he'></a> sail; and
the other end of it is passed six or seven times round the yard-arm
and through the cringle, thereby fastening the latter to the former.
Two of the turns are intended to stretch the upper-edge of the sail
tight along the yard; and the rest to draw it close up to it. The former
are therefore called <i>outer</i>, and the latter <i>inner</i> turns, as being passed
without, or within the rigging, on the yard-arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>EASE <i>the ship</i>! the command given by the pilot to the steersman, to
put the helm close to the lee-side, or, in the sea-phrase, <i>hard-a-lee</i>, when
the ship is expected to <i>pitch</i> or plunge her fore-part deep in the water,
while close-hauled. The reason usually given for this practice is, that
the sudden movement of the helm prevents the ship’s head from falling
with so much weight and rapidity into the hollow of the sea, as it
would do otherwise: which is presuming that the flow, and uncertain
effect of the helm is sufficient to retard the certain and violent action
of gravity: a position that necessarily infers a very singular theory of
mechanics. We shall not endeavour to advance any argument in favour
of this practice; only to remark, that it is most religiously observed,
both in merchant-ships and his majesty’s navy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Ease</span> <i>off</i>, or <span class='sc'>Ease</span> <i>away</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">molir</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filer</span></i>, to slacken gradually any single
rope, or complication of ropes, formed into a tackle.</p>

<p class='c008'>EBB, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jussant</span></i>, the reflux of the tide, or the return of it into the sea
after the highest of the flood, usually termed full-sea, or high-water.</p>

<p class='c008'>EDDY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">remoux</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ed</span></i>, backward, again, and <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ea</span></i>, water, Sax.) the water
that, by some interruption in its course, runs contrary to the direction
of any river, or current, and appears like the motion of a whirlpool.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> EDGE <i>away</i>, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abattre</span></i>, to decline gradually from
the shore, or from the line of the course which the ship formerly
steered: it is particularly applied when a ship changes her course, by
sailing nearer the direction of the wind; or, in the lea-language, by sailing
<i>larger</i>, or more <i>afore</i> the wind, than she had done before that operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>ELBOW <i>in the hause</i>, a particular twist in the cables by which a ship
rides at anchor. In this situation each of the cables, after crossing the
other before the stem, is directed outwards on the same <i>bow</i> from which
it issued: that is to say, the starboard cable <i>grows</i> out on the starboard
bow, and the larboard cable on the larboard bow, as exhibited in fig. 36,
plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. where a expresses the fore-castle, b the stem, c c the larboard
cable, and d d the starboard one. See the article <span class='sc'>Hawse</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>EMBARGO, in commerce, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arret</span></i> (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">embargar</span></i>, Span.), an arrest laid on
ships or merchandise by public authority, or a prohibition of state,
commonly issued on foreign ships, to prevent their putting to sea in
time of war; and sometimes to prevent their coming in, and otherwise
both to prevent their entrance and departure.</p>

<p class='c008'>EMBAYED, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encapé</span></i>, (from <i>bay</i>,) the situation of a ship when she is
inclosed between two capes or promontories. It is particularly applied
when the wind, by blowing strongly into any bay or gulf, makes it
extremely difficult, and perhaps impracticable, for the vessel thus enclosed,
to <i>claw</i> off from the shore, so as to weather the capes and arrive
into the offing.</p>

<p class='c008'>ENGAGEMENT, in a naval sense, implies a particular or general
battle at sea; or an action of hostility between single ships, or <i>detachments</i>,
or <i>squadrons</i> of men of war.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to have a clearer idea of this article, it will, therefore, be necessary
that the reader who is little acquainted with the subject, should
previously refer to the explanation of those terms, as also to the articles
<span class='sc'>Cannon</span>, <span class='sc'>Division</span>, <span class='sc'>Exercise</span>, <span class='sc'>Fleet</span>, and <span class='sc'>Line</span> <i>of</i> <span class='sc'>Battle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sea-fights of the ancients were usually carried on in two different
manners. Advanced by the force of their oars, the gallies ran violently
<i>aboard</i> of each other, and by the mutual encounter of their beaks and
prows, and sometimes of their sterns, endeavoured to dash in pieces,
or sink their enemies.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prow, for this purpose, was commonly armed with a brazen
point or trident, nearly as low as the surface of the sea, in order to
pierce the enemy’s ships under the water. Some of the gallies were
furnished with large turrets, and other accessions of building, either for
attack or defence. The soldiers also annoyed their enemies with darts
and slings, and, on their nearer approach, with swords and javelins;
and, in order that their missive weapons might be directed with greater
force and certainty, the ships were equipped with several platforms, or
elevations above the level of the deck<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a>. The sides of the ship were
fortified with a thick fence of hides, which served to repel the darts
of their adversaries, and to cover their own soldiers, who thereby annoyed
the enemy with greater security.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the invention of gun-powder has rendered useless many of the
machines employed in the naval wars of the ancients, the great distance
of time has also consigned many of them to oblivion: some few are,
nevertheless, recorded in ancient authors, of which we shall endeavour
to present a short description. And first,</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δελφιν</span> was a large and massy piece of lead or iron, cast in the
form of a dolphin. This machine being suspended by blocks at their
mast-heads or yard-arms, ready for a proper occasion, was let down
violently from thence into the adverse ships, and either penetrated
through their bottom, and opened a passage for the entering waters,
or by its weight immediately sunk the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δρήπαναν</span> an engine of iron crooked like a sickle, and fixed
on the top of a long pole. It was employed to cut asunder the <i>slings</i> of
the sail-yards, and, thereby letting the sails fall down, to disable the vessel
from escaping, and incommode her greatly during the action. Similar
to this was another instrument, armed at the head with a broad
two-edged blade of iron, wherewith they usually cut away the ropes
that fastened the rudder to the vessel<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δόρατα ναύμαχα</span>, a sort of spears or maces of an extraordinary length,
sometimes exceeding twenty cubits, as appears by the 15th Iliad of
Homer<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a>, by whom they are also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μακρὰ</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κιραῖαι</span> were certain machines used to throw large stones into the
enemies ships.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vegetius mentions another engine, which was suspended to the main-mast,
and resembled a battering-ram: for it consisted of a long beam,
and an head of iron, and was, with great violence, pushed against the
sides of the enemies gallies.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had also a grappling-iron, which was usually thrown into the
adverse ship by means of an engine: this instrument facilitated the entrance
of the soldiers appointed to <i>board</i>, which was done by means
of wooden bridges, that were generally kept ready for this purpose in
the fore-part of the vessel<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The arms used by the ancients rendered the disposition of their fleets
very different, according to the time, place and circumstances. They generally
considered it an advantage to be to windward, and to have the sun
shining directly on the front of their enemy. The order of battle chiefly
depended on their power of managing the ships, or of drawing them
readily into form; and on the schemes which their officers had concerted.
The fleet being composed of rowing-vessels, they lowered their sails
previous to the action: they presented their prows to the enemy, and
advanced against each other by the force of their oars<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a>. Before they
joined battle, the admirals went from ship to ship, and exhorted their
soldiers to behave gallantly. All things being in readiness, the signal
was displayed by hanging out of the admiral’s galley a gilded shield,
or a red garment or banner. During the elevation of this the action
continued, and by its depression, or inclination towards the right or
left, the rest of the ships were directed how to attack, or retreat from
their enemies. To this was added the sound of trumpets, which began
in the admiral’s galley, and continued round the whole navy. The
light was also begun by the admiral’s galley, by grappling, boarding,
and endeavouring to overset, sink, or destroy, the adversary, as we
have above described<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a>. Sometimes, for want of grappling irons, they
fixed their oars in such a manner as to hinder the enemy from retreating.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
If they could not manage their oars as dexterously as their antagonists,
or fall along-side so as to board him, they penetrated his
vessel with the brazen prow. The vessels approached each other as
well as their circumstances would permit, and the soldiers were
obliged to fight hand to hand, till the battle was decided: nor indeed
could they fight otherwise with any certainty, since the shortest distance
rendered their slings and arrows, and almost all their offensive
weapons, ineffectual, if not useless. The squadrons were sometimes
ranged in two or three right lines, parallel to each other; being seldom
drawn up in one line, unless when formed into an half moon.
This order indeed appears to be the most convenient for rowing vessels
that engage by advancing with their prows towards the enemy. At
the battle of Ecnomus, between the Romans and the Carthaginians,
the fleet of the former was ranged into a triangle, or a sort of wedge in
front, and towards the middle of its depth, of two right parallel lines.
That of the latter was formed into a rectangle, or two sides of a square,
of which one branch extended behind, and, as the opening of the other
prosecuted the attack, was ready to fall upon the flank of such of the Roman
gallies as should attempt to break their line. Ancient history has preserved
many of these orders, of which some have been followed in later
times. Thus, in a battle in A. D. 1340, the English fleet was formed in
two lines, the first of which contained the larger ships, the second consisted
of all the smaller vessels, used as a reserve to support the former whenever
necessary. In 1545 the French fleet under the command of the Mareschal
d’Annebault, in an engagement with the English in the Channel,
was arranged in the form of a crescent. The whole of it was divided
into three bodies, the center being composed of thirty-six ships, and
each of the wings of thirty. He had also many gallies; but these fell
not into the line, being designed to attack the enemy occasionally.
This last disposition was continued down to the reigns of James I. and
Louis XIII<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile the invention of gun-powder, in 1330, gradually introduced
the use of fire-arms into naval war, without finally superseding
the ancient method of engagement. The Spaniards were armed with
cannon in a sea-fight against the English and the people of Poitou
abreast of Rochelle in 1372; and this battle is the first wherein mention
is made of artillery in our navies. Many years elapsed before the marine
armaments were sufficiently provided with fire-arms<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a>. So great a revolution
in the manner of fighting, and which necessarily introduced a total
change in the construction of ships, could not be suddenly effected.
In short, the squadrons of men of war are no longer formed of rowing-vessels,
or composed of gallies and ships of the line, but entirely of the
latter, which engage under sail, and discharge the whole force of their
artillery from their sides. Accordingly they are now disposed in no other
form than that of a right line parallel to the enemy; every ship keeping
<i>close-hauled</i> upon a wind on the same tack. Indeed the difference between
the force and manner of fighting of ships and gallies rendered their service
in the same line incompatible. When we consider therefore the
change introduced, both in the construction and working of ships, occasioned
by the use of cannon, it necessarily follows, that squadrons of
men of war must appear in the order that is now generally adopted.
Finally, the ships ought to present their broad-sides to the enemy; and to
sail close upon a wind in the wake of each other; as well to retain their
own uniformity, as to preserve or acquire the advantage which the
weather-gage gives them over their adversary<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The machines which owe their rise to the invention of gun powder
have now totally supplanted the others; so that there is scarce any but
the sword remaining, of all the weapons used by the ancients. Our naval
battles are therefore almost always decided by fire-arms, of which there
are several kinds, known by the general name of artillery.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a ship of war fire-arms are distinguished into cannon mounted on
carriages, swivel-cannon, grenadoes, and musquetry. The first has
been already described at large in its proper place. The second is a small
piece of artillery, carrying a shot of half a pound, and fixed in a socket
on the top of the ships side, stern or bow, and also in her tops. The
trunnions of this piece are contained in a sort of iron crotch, whose
lower-end terminates in a cylindrical pivot resting in the socket, so as to
support the weight of the cannon. The socket is bored in a strong
piece of oak, reinforced with iron hoops, in order to enable it to sustain
the recoil. By means of this frame, which is called the swivel, and
an iron handle on its cascabel, the gun may be directed by hand to
any object. It is therefore very necessary in the tops, particularly when
loaded with musket-balls, to fire down on the upper-decks of the
adversary in action.——The grenado is a kind of little bomb of the
same diameter as a four pound bullet; it weighs about two pounds,
being charged with four or five ounces of powder.——Grenadoes
are thrown from the tops by the hands of the seamen. They have a
touch-hole in the same manner as a bomb, and a fuse of the same composition.
See <span class='sc'>Mortar</span>. The sailor fires the fuse with a match, and
throws the grenado as he is directed: the powder being inflamed, the
shell instantly bursts into splinters, that kill or maim whomsoever they
reach on the decks of the enemy. As this machine cannot be thrown
by hand above fifteen or sixteen fathoms, the ship must be pretty near,
to render it useful in battle.——The musket or firelock is so well
known, that it appears unnecessary to describe it in this place.—Besides
these machines, there are several others used in merchant-ships and
privateers, as coehorns, carabines, fire-arrows, organs, powder-flasks,
stink-pots, &amp;c<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since a general engagement of fleets or squadrons of men of war
is nothing else than a variety of particular actions of single ships with
each other, in a line of battle; it appears necessary, according to the
plan of this work, to begin by describing the latter, and then proceed to
represent the usual manner of conducting the former.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole oeconomy of a naval engagement may be arranged under
the following heads, viz. the preparation; the action; and the repair, or
refitting, for the purposes of navigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The preparation is began by issuing the order to clear the ship for
action, which is repeated by the boatswain and his mates at all the</p>

<p class='c008'><i>hatchways</i> or stair-cases, leading to the different batteries. As the management
of the artillery in a vessel of war requires a considerable number
of men, it is evident that the officers and sailors must be restrained to
a narrow space in their usual habitations, in order to preserve the internal
regularity of the ship. Hence the <i>hammocs</i>, or hanging-beds, of the
latter are crowded together as close as possible between the decks, each
of them being limited to the breadth of fourteen inches. They are hung
parallel to each other, in rows stretching from one side of the ship to the
other, nearly throughout her whole length, so as to admit of no passage
but by stooping under them. As the cannon therefore cannot be worked
while the hammocs are suspended in this situation, it becomes necessary
to remove them as quick as possible. By this circumstance a
double advantage is obtained: the batteries of cannon are immediately
cleared of an incumbrance, and the hammocs are converted into a sort
of parapet, to prevent the execution of small-shot on the <i>quarter-deck</i>,
<i>tops</i>, and <i>fore-castle</i>. At the summons of the boatswain, <i>Up all hammocs!</i>
every sailor repairs to his own, and, having stowed his bedding properly,
he cords it up firmly with a <i>lashing</i>, or line provided for that
purpose. He then carries it to the quarter-deck, poop, or forecastle,
or wherever it may be necessary. As each side of the quarter-deck and
poop is furnished with a double net-work, supported by iron cranes
fixed immediately above the <i>gunnel</i> or top of the ship’s-side; the hammocs
thus corded are firmly stowed by the quarter-master between the
two parts of the netting, so as to form an excellent barrier. The tops,
waiste, and fore-castle, are then fenced in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whilst these offices are performed below, the boatswain and his mates
are employed in securing the sail-yards, to prevent them from tumbling
down when the ship is cannonaded, as she might thereby be
disabled, and rendered incapable of attack, retreat, or pursuit. The
yards are now likewise secured by strong chains, or ropes, additional to
those by which they are usually suspended. The boatswain also provides
the necessary materials to repair the rigging, wherever it may be
damaged by the shot of the enemy; and to supply whatever parts of
it may be entirely destroyed. The carpenter and his crew in the meanwhile
prepare his shot-plugs and mauls, to close up any dangerous
breaches that may be made near the surface of the water; and provide
the iron-work necessary to refit the chain-pumps, in case their machinery
should be wounded in the engagement. The gunner with his mates
and quarter-gunners is busied in examining the cannon of the different
batteries, to see that their charges are thoroughly dry and fit for execution:
to have every thing ready for furnishing the great guns and
small arms with powder, as soon as the action begins: and to keep a
sufficient number of cartridges continually filled, to supply the place of
those expended in battle. The master and his mates are attentive to
have the sails properly trimmed, according to the situation of the ship;
and to reduce or multiply them, as occasion requires, with all possible
expedition. The lieutenants visit the different decks, to see that they
are effectually cleared of all incumbrance, so that nothing may retard
the execution of the artillery: and to enjoin the other officers to diligence
and alertness, in making the necessary dispositions for the expected
engagement, so that every thing may be in readiness at a moment’s
warning.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the hostile ships have approached each other to a competent
distance, the drums beat to arms. The boatswain and his mates pipe, <i>all
hands to quarters!</i> at every hatchway. All the persons appointed to manage
the great guns, immediately repair to their respective stations.
The crows, handspikes, rammers, spunges, powder-horns, matches, and
train tackles, are placed in order by the side of every cannon. The
hatches are immediately laid, to prevent any one from deserting his post
by escaping into the lower apartments. The marines are drawn up in
rank and file, on the quarter-deck, poop, and fore-castle. The lashings
of the great guns are cast loose, and the tompions withdrawn. The
whole artillery, above and below, is run out at the ports, and levelled
to the point-blank range ready for firing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The necessary preparations being completed, and the officers and
crew ready at their respective stations, to obey the order, the commencement
of the action is determined by the mutual distance and situation
of the adverse ships, or by the signal from the commander in
chief of the fleet or squadron. The cannon being levelled in parallel
rows, projecting from the ship’s side, the most natural order of battle
is evidently to range the ships abreast of each other, especially if the
engagement is general. The most convenient distance is probably within
the point-blank range of a musket, so that all the artillery may do
effectual execution.</p>

<p class='c008'>The combat usually begins by a vigorous cannonade, accompanied
with the whole efforts of the swivel-guns and the small arms. The
method of firing in platoons, or vollies of cannon at once, appears inconvenient
in the sea-service, and perhaps should never be attempted,
unless in the battering of a fortification. The sides and decks of the
ship, although sufficiently strong for all the purposes of war, would be
too much shaken by so violent an explosion and recoil. The general
rule observed on this occasion throughout the ship, is to load, fire, and
spunge, the guns with all possible expedition, yet without confusion
or precipitation. The captain of each gun is particularly enjoined to
fire only when the piece is properly directed to its object, that the shot
may not be fruitlessly expended. The lieutenants who command the
different batteries, traverse the deck to see that the battle is prosecuted
with vivacity; and to exhort and animate the men to their duty. The
midshipmen second these injunctions, and give the necessary assistance
wherever it may be required, at the guns committed to their charge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gunner should be particularly attentive that all the artillery is sufficiently
supplied with powder, and that the cartridges are carefully conveyed
along the decks in covered boxes. The havoc produced by a continuation
of this mutual assault may be readily conjectured by the reader’s
imagination: battering, penetrating, and splintering the sides and decks;
shattering or dismounting the cannon; mangling and destroying the rigging;
cutting asunder, or carrying away the masts and yards; piercing
and tearing the sails so as to render them useless; and wounding, disabling,
or killing the ship’s company! The comparative vigour and resolution
of the assailants to effect these pernicious consequences in each
other, generally determine their success or defeat: I say generally, because
the fate of the combat may sometimes be decided by an unforeseen
incident, equally fortunate for the one and fatal to the other. The
defeated ship having acknowledged the victory, by striking her colours,
is immediately taken possession of by the conqueror, who secures her
officers and crew as prisoners in his own ship; and invests his principal
officer with the command of the prize until a captain is appointed by
the commander in chief.</p>

<p class='c008'>The engagement being concluded, they begin the repair: the cannon are
secured by their breechings and tackles, with all convenient expedition.
Whatever sails have been rendered unserviceable are unbent; and the
wounded masts and yards struck upon the deck, and <i>fished</i>, or replaced by
others. The standing rigging is <i>knotted</i>, and the running rigging spliced
wherever necessary. Proper sails are bent in the room of those which have
been displaced as useless. The carpenter and his crew are employed in
repairing the breaches made in the ship’s hull, by shot-plugs, pieces of
plank, and sheet-lead. The gunner and his assistants are busied in replenishing
the allotted number of charged cartridges, to supply the place of
those which have been expended, and in refitting whatever furniture of
the cannon may have been damaged by the late action.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is the usual process and consequences of an engagement between
two ships of war, which may be considered as an epitome of a general
battle between fleets or squadrons, The latter, however, involves a
greater variety of incidents, and necessarily requires more comprehensive
skill and judgment in the commanding officer.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the admiral, or commander in chief, of a naval armament has
discovered an enemy’s fleet, his principal concern is usually to approach
it, and endeavour to come to action as soon as possible. Every inferior
consideration must be sacrificed to this important object; and
every rule of action should tend to hasten and prepare for so material
an event. The state of the wind, and the situation of his adversary,
will, in some measure, dictate the conduct necessary to be pursued with
regard to the disposition of his ships on this occasion. To facilitate
the execution of the admiral’s orders, the whole fleet is ranged into
three squadrons, each of which is classed into three divisions, under the
command of different officers. Before the action begins, the adverse
fleets are commonly drawn up in two lines parallel to each other, and
close-hauled. We have endeavoured to explain the propriety and necessity
of this disposition in the article <i>Line</i>. As soon as the admiral
displays the signal for the line of battle, the several divisions separate
from the columns, in which they were disposed in the usual order of sailing,
and every ship crouds into its station in the <i>wake</i>, of the next a-head:
and a proper distance from each other, which is generally about fifty
fathom, is regularly observed from the van to the rear. The admiral,
however, will, occasionally, contract or extend his line, so as to conform
to the length of that of his adversary, whose neglect, or inferior skill,
on this occasion, he will naturally convert to his own advantage; as
well as to prevent his own line from being <i>doubled</i>, a circumstance which
might throw his van and rear into confusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the adverse fleets approach each other, the <i>courses</i> are commonly
hauled up in the brails, and the top-gallant sails and stay sails furled.
The movement of each ship is chiefly regulated by the main and fore-top
sails, and the jib; the mizen-top sail being reserved to hasten or retard
the course of the ship, and, in fine, by <i>filling</i> or <i>backing</i>, <i>hoisting</i> or
<i>lowering</i> it, to determine her velocity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The frigates, tenders, and fire-ships, being also hauled upon a wind,
lie at some distance, ready to execute the admiral’s orders, or those of
his seconds, leaving the line of battle between them and the enemy. If
there are any transports and store-ships attendant on the fleet, these are
disposed still further distant from the action. If the fleet is superior in
number to that of the enemy, the admiral usually selects a body of reserve
from the different squadrons, which will always be of use to cover
the fire-ships, bomb-vessels, &amp;c. and may fall into the line in any
case of necessity: these also are stationed at a convenient distance from
the line, and should evidently be opposite to the weakest parts thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>And here it may not be improper to observe, with an ingenious French
author<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a>, that order and discipline give additional strength and activity
to a fleet. If thus a double advantage is acquired by every fleet, it is
certainly more favourable to the inferior, which may thereby change its
disposition with greater facility and dispatch than one more numerous,
yet without being separated. When courage is equal to both, good
order is then the only resource of the smaller number. Hence we may
infer that a smaller squadron of men of war, whose officers are perfectly
disciplined in working their ships, may, by its superior dexterity, vanquish
a more powerful one, even at the commencement of the fight;
because the latter being less expert in the order of battle, will, by its
separation, suffer many of the ships to remain useless, or not sufficiently
near, to protect each other<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The signal for a general engagement is usually displayed when the
opposite fleets are sufficiently within the <i>range</i> of point-blank shot, so
that they may level the artillery with certainty of execution, which is
near enough for a line of battle. The action is begun and carried on
throughout the fleet, in the manner we have already described between
single ships, at which time the admiral carries little sail, observing,
however, to regulate his own motions by those of the enemy. The
ships of the line mean while keep close in their stations, none of which
should hesitate to advance in their order, although interrupted by the
situation of some ship a-head, which has negligently fallen astern of her
station.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is now the practice of naval war, that the necessary order of battle,
and the fabric of our ships, very seldom permit the assault of
<i>boarding</i>, unless in single actions. No captain ought therefore to abandon
his station in the line, under any pretence whatsoever, unless his
ship is too much disabled to continue the combat. The small quantity
of sail carried on this occasion will permit the bulk of the fleet, altho’
somewhat impaired, to continue their cannonade a long time without
quitting the line.</p>

<p class='c008'>An ambition to distinguish himself should never seduce any captain
to break the line, in order to atchieve any distant enterprize, however
the prospect may flatter him with success. He ought to wait the signal
of the admiral or his commanding officer; because it is more essential to
preserve the regularity of a close line, which constitutes the principal
force of the fleet, than to prosecute a particular action, which, although
brilliant in itself, has seldom any material consequences, unless its object
is to seize a flag-ship, and even this can only be justified by
success<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The various exigencies of the combat call forth the skill and resources
of the admiral, to keep his line as complete as possible, when it has
been unequally attacked; by ordering ships from those in reserve, to
supply the place of others which have suffered greatly by the action; by
directing his fire-ships at a convenient time to fall aboard the enemy; by
detaching ships from one part of the line or wing which is stronger, to
another which is greatly pressed by superior force, and requires assistance.
His vigilance is ever necessary to review the situation of the enemy
from van to rear, every motion of whom he should, if possible, anticipate
and frustrate. He should seize the favourable moments of occasion,
which are rapid in their progress, and never return. Far from being
disconcerted by any unforeseen incident, he should endeavour, if possible,
to make it subservient to his design. His experience and reflection
will naturally furnish him with every method of intelligence to discover
the state of his different squadrons and divisions. Signals of enquiry
and answers; of request and assent; of command and obedience; will be
displayed and repeated on this occasion. Tenders and boats will also
continually be detached between the admiral and the commanders of
the several squadrons or divisions.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the danger presses on him, he ought to be fortified by resolution
and presence of mind, because the whole fleet is committed to his
charge, and the conduct of his officers may, in a great degree, be influenced
by his intrepidity and perseverance. In short, his renown or infamy
may depend on the fate of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>If he conquers in battle, he ought to prosecute his victory as much
as possible, by seizing, burning, or destroying the enemies ships. If
he is defeated, he should endeavour by every resource his experience
can suggest, to have as many of his fleet as possible; by employing
his tenders, &amp;c. to take out the wounded and put fresh men in their
places; by towing the disabled ships to a competent distance, and by
preventing the execution of the enemies fire-ships. In order to retreat
with more security, he may judge it expedient to range his fleet into
the form of an half-moon, placing himself in the center. By this disposition
the enemy’s ships which attempt to fall upon his rear, will at
once expose themselves to the fire of the admiral, and his seconds, in a
disadvantageous situation; a circumstance which will serve to facilitate
the escape of his own ships, and retard the pursuit of those of his adversary.</p>

<p class='c008'>If his fleet is too much extended by this arrangement, the wings
or quarters are easily closed, and the half-moon rendered more complete;
in the midst of which may be placed his store-ships, tenders,
&amp;c. In flying, or retreating, the uncertainty of the weather is to be
considered: it may become calm, or the wind may shift in his favour.
His schemes may be assisted by the approach of night, or the proximity
of the land; since he ought rather to run the ships ashore, if practicable,
than suffer them to be taken afloat, and thereby transfer additional
strength to the enemy. In short, nothing should be neglected
that may contribute to the preservation of his fleet, or prevent any
part of it from falling into the hands of the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c008'>By what we have observed, the real force, or superiority, of a fleet
consists less in the number of vessels, and the vivacity of the action,
than in good order, dexterity in working the ships, presence of mind,
and skilful conduct in the captains.</p>

<p class='c008'>ENSIGN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavillon de pouppe</span></i>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enseigne</span></i>, Fr.) a large standard, or banner,
hoisted on a long pole erected over the poop, and called the ensign-staff.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ensign is used to distinguish the ships of different nations from
each other, as also to characterise the different squadrons of the navy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The British ensign in ships of war is known by a double cross, viz.
that of St. George and St. Andrew, formed into an union, upon a
field which is either red, white, or blue.</p>

<p class='c008'>ENTERING <span class='sc'>Ropes</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tire-veilles</span></i>, two ropes hanging from the upper-part
of a ship’s-side, on the right and left of the accommodation-ladder,
or steps of the gangway. See <span class='sc'>Gangway</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>ENTRANCE, a name frequently given to the foremost part of a
ship under the surface of the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> EQUIP, a term borrowed from the French marine, and frequently
applied to the business of fitting a ship for sea, or arming her for war.
See the article <span class='sc'>Fitting</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>ESCUTCHEON, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ecusson</span></i>, Fr.) a name sometimes given to the compartment
for the name, or arms, of the owner, or of the person whose
title the vessel assumes: it is usually fixed on the middle of the ship’s
stern, and is more peculiar to the French and other foreigners, than
to English built vessels. See fig. 3, plate 10.</p>

<p class='c008'>EXERCISE is the preparatory practice of managing the artillery and
small-arms, in order to make the ship’s crew perfectly skilled therein,
so as to direct its execution successfully in the time of battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exercise of the great guns has, till the late war, been very complicated,
and abounding with superfluities, in our navy, as well as all
others. The following method was then successfully introduced by an
officer of distinguished abilities.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Upon beat to arms<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> (every body having immediately repaired to
their quarters) the midshipman commanding a number of guns, is to see
that they are not without every necessary article, as (at every gun) a
spunge, powder-horn, with its priming wires, and a sufficient quantity
of powder, crow, hand-spike, bed, quoin, train-tackle, &amp;c. sending,
without delay, for a supply of any thing that may be missing; and, for
the greater certainty of not overlooking any deficiency, he is to give
strict orders to each captain under him, to make the like examination
at his respective gun, and to take care that every requisite is in a serviceable
condition, which he is to report accordingly. And (besides
the other advantages of this regulation) for the still more certain and
speedy account being taken upon these occasions, the midshipman is
to give each man his charge at quarters (as expressed in the form of the
monthly report) who is to search for his particular implements, and,
not finding it, is immediately to acquaint his captain, that, upon his
report to the midshipman, it may be replaced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The man who takes care of the powder is to place himself on the
opposite side of the deck from that where we engage, except when
fighting both sides at once, when he is to be amidships. He is not to
suffer any other man to take a cartridge from him, but he who is appointed
to serve the gun with that article, either in time of a real engagement,
or at exercise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lanthorns are not to be brought to quarters in the night, until the
midshipman gives his orders for so doing to the person he charges with
that article. Every thing being in its place, and not the least lumber
in the way of the guns, the exercise begins with,</p>

<h4 class='c014'>1st, Silence.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“At this word every one is to observe a silent attention to the officers.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>2d. Cast loose your guns.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The muzzle lashing is to be taken off from the guns, and (being
coiled up in a small compass) is to be made fast to the eye-bolt above
the port. The lashing-tackles at the same time to be cast loose, and
the middle of the breeching seized to the thimble of the pomillion.
The spunge to be taken down, and, with the crow, hand-spike, &amp;c.
laid upon the deck by the gun.</p>

<p class='c008'>“N. B. When prepared for engaging an enemy, the seizing within the
clinch of the breeching is to be cut, that the gun may come sufficiently
within-board for loading, and that the force of the recoil may be more
spent before it acts upon the breeching.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>3d. Level your guns.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The breech of your metal is to be raised so as to admit the foot
of the bed’s being placed upon the axle-tree of the carriage, with the
quoin upon the bed, both their ends being even one with the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“N. B. When levelled for firing, the bed is to be lashed to the bolt
which supports the inner end of it, that it may not be thrown out of
its place by the violence of the gun’s motion, when hot with frequent
discharges. See fig. 17, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>4th. Take out your tompions.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The tompion is to be taken out of the gun’s mouth, and left hanging
by its laniard.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>5th. Run out your guns.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“With the tackles hooked to the upper-bolts of the carriage, the gun
is to be bowsed out as close as possible, without the assistance of crows
or hand-spikes; taking care at the same time to keep the breeching clear
of the trucks, by hauling it through the rings; it is then to be bent so
as to run clear when the gun is fired. When the gun is out, the tackle-falls
are to be laid along-side the carriages in neat fakes, that when
the gun by recoiling overhauls them, they may not be subject to get
foul, as they would if in a common coil.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>6th. Prime.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“If the cartridge is to be pierced with the priming wire, and the vent
filled with powder, the pan also is to be filled; and the flat space having
a score through it at the end of the pan, is to be covered, and this
part of the priming is to be bruised with the round part of the horn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The apron is to be laid over, and the horn hung up out of danger
from the flash of the priming.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>7th. Point your guns.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“At this command the gun is, in the first place, to be elevated to
the height of the object, by means of the side-sights; and then the person
pointing is to direct his fire by the upper-sight, having a crow on
one side and a hand-spike on the other, to heave the gun by his direction
till he catches the object.</p>

<p class='c008'>“N. B. The men who heave the gun for pointing, are to stand between
the ship’s side and their crows or hand-spikes, to escape the injury
they might otherwise receive from their being struck against them, or
splintered by a shot; and the man who attends the captain with a match
is to bring it at the word, “Point your guns,” and kneeling upon
one knee opposite the train-truck of the carriage, and at such a distance
as to be able to touch the priming, is to turn his head from the
gun, and keep blowing gently upon the lighted match to keep it clear
from ashes. And as the missing of an enemy in action, by neglect or
want of coolness, is most inexcusable, it is particularly recommended to
have the people thoroughly instructed in pointing well, and taught to
know the ill consequences of not taking proper means to hit their
mark; wherefore they should be made to elevate their guns to the utmost
nicety, and then to point with the same exactness, having caught
the object through the upper-sight at the word,</p>

<h4 class='c014'>8th. fire.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The match is instantly to be put to the bruised part of the priming;
and when the gun is discharged the vent is to be closed, in order to
smother any spark of fire that may remain in the chamber of the gun;
and the man who spunges is immediately to place himself by the muzzle
of the gun in readiness, when, at the next word,</p>

<h4 class='c014'>9th. Spunge your gun.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The spunge is to be rammed down to the bottom of the chamber,
and then twisted round, to extinguish effectually any remains of fire;
and when drawn out, to be struck against the out-side of the muzzle, to
shake off any sparks or scraps of the cartridge that may have come out
with it; and next its end is to be shifted ready for loading; and while
this is doing, the man appointed to provide a cartridge is to go to the
box, and by the time the spunge is out of the gun, he is to have it
ready; and, at the word,</p>

<h4 class='c014'>10th. Load with cartridge.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The cartridge (with the bottom-end first, seam-downwards, and a
wad after it) is to be put into the gun, and thrust a little way within
the mouth, when the rammer is to be entered; the cartridge is then to
be forcibly rammed down, and the captain at the same time is to keep
his priming-wire in the vent, and, feeling the cartridge, is to give the
word <i>home</i>, when the rammer is to be drawn, and not before. While
this is doing, the man appointed to provide a shot is to provide one (or
two, according to the order at that time) ready at the muzzle, with a
wad likewise, and when the rammer is drawn, at the word,</p>

<h4 class='c014'>11th. Shot your guns.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The shot and wad upon it are to be put into the gun, and thrust a
little way down, when the rammer is to be entered as before. The
shot and wad are to be rammed down to the cartridge, and there have a
couple of forcible strokes, when the rammer is to be drawn, and laid
out of the way of the guns and tackles, if the exercise or action is
continued; but if it is over, the spunge is to be secured in the place
it is at all times kept in.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>12th. Put in your tompions.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The tompions to be put into the muzzle of the cannon.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>13th. House your guns.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The seizing is to be put on again upon the clinched end of the
breeching, leaving it no slacker than to admit of the guns being housed
with ease. The quoin is to be taken from under the breech of the gun,
and the bed, still resting upon the bolt, within the carriage, thrust under,
till the foot of it falls off the axle-tree, leaving it to rest upon the
end which projects out from the foot. The metal is to be let down
upon this. The gun is to be placed exactly square, and the muzzle
is to be close to the wood, in its proper place for passing the muzzle
lashings. See <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>, and fig. 19, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>14th. Secure your guns.</h4>

<p class='c015'>“The muzzle lashings must first be made secure, and then with one
tackle (having all its parts equally taught with the breeching) the gun
is to be lashed. The other tackle is to be bowsed taught, and by itself
made fast, that it may be ready to cast off for lashing a second breeching.</p>

<p class='c008'>“N. B. Care must be taken to hook the first tackle to the upper bolt
of the carriage, that it may not otherwise obstruct the reeving of the
second breeching, and to give the greater length to the end part of the
fall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No pains must be spared in bowsing the lashing very taught, that
the gun may have the least play that is possible, as their being loose
may be productive of very dangerous consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The quoin, crow, and handspike, are to be put under the gun, the
powder-horn hung up in its place, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Being engaged at any time when there is a large swell, a rough sea,
or in squally weather, &amp;c. as the ship may be liable to be suddenly much
heeled, the port-tackle falls is to be kept clear, and (whenever the working
of the gun will admit of it) the man charged with that office is to
keep it in his hand; at the same time the muzzle lashing is to be kept
fast to the ring of the port, and being hauled taught, is to be fastened
to the eye-bolt over the port-hole, so as to be out of the gun’s way in
firing, in order to haul it in at any time of danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This precaution is not to be omitted, when engaging to the windward,
any more than when to the leeward, those situations being very
subject to alter at too short a warning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A train tackle is always to be made use of with the lee-guns, and the
man stationed to attend it is to be very careful in preventing the gun’s
running out at an improper time.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Exercise</span> may also be applied with propriety to the forming our fleets
into orders of sailing, lines of battle, &amp;c. an art which the French
have termed <i>evolutions</i>, or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tactiques</span></i>. In this sense exercise may be defined,
the execution of the movements which the different orders and disposition
of fleets occasionally require, and which the several ships are directed
to perform by means of signals.</p>

<p class='c008'>EYE <i>of a block-strop</i>. In the article <span class='sc'>Block</span> it has been mentioned, that
a block is commonly bound with a ring, or wreath, formed of a piece
of rope, called the <i>strop</i>; the eye of the strop, therefore, is that part by
which it is fastened, or suspended, to any particular place upon the
sails, yards, or rigging, the eye whereof is represented by fig. 37, plate
<a href='#II'>II</a>. The eye is sometimes formed by fastening the two ends of the
strop together with a short line, so as to bind round a mast, yard, or
boom, as occasion requires. See fig. 38, of the same plate.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Eye</span> <i>of a stay</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oeillet</span></i>, that part of a stay which is formed into a sort of
collar to go round a mast-head.</p>

<p class='c008'>EYE-BOLT, a long bar of iron with an eye in one end of it, represented
by fig. 39, plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. It is formed to be driven into the decks or
sides of a ship for divers purposes, as to hook <i>tackles</i>, or fasten ropes
to, as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>EYE-LET-HOLE. See the article <i>Sails</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>EYES <i>of a ship</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oeils</span></i>, a name frequently given to those parts which
lie near the hause-holes, particularly in the lower apartments within the
vessel.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>F.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>FACTOR, in commerce, an agent, or correspondent, residing beyond
the seas, or in some remote part, and commissioned by merchants
to buy or sell goods on their account, or assist them to carry on their
trade. Hence any place where a considerable number of factors reside,
to negociate for their masters, or employers, is called a factory; as the
factories of Lisbon, of Leghorn, of Calcutta, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>FAG-END, the end of any rope, or cord, which is become untwisted
and loosened by frequent use. To prevent this effect, the ends of
ropes are generally well fastened by winding a piece of small line, or
pack-thread, around them, which operation is called <i>whipping</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FAIR, a general term for the disposition of the wind, when it is favourable
to a ship’s course, in opposition to that which is contrary or
<i>foul</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>This term, when applied to the wind, is much more comprehensive
than <i>large</i>, since the former seems to include about eighteen points
of the compass, or at least sixteen; whereas <i>large</i> is confined to the
beam or quarter, that is, to a wind which crosses the keel at right angles,
or obliquely from the stern, but never to one right a-stern. See the
articles <span class='sc'>Large</span> and <span class='sc'>Scant</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FAIR-CURVE, a winding line, used in delineating ships, whose shape
is varied according to the part of the ship it is intended to describe:
this curve is not answerable to any of the figures of conic sections,
although it occasionally partakes of them all.</p>

<p class='c008'>FAIR WAY, the path or channel of a narrow bay, river, or haven, in
which ships usually advance in their passage up and down; so that if
any vessels are anchored therein, they are said to lye in the fair-way.</p>

<p class='c008'>FAKE, one of the circles, or windings, of a cable, or hauser, as it
lies disposed in the coil. See the article <span class='sc'>Coiling</span>. The fakes are greater
or smaller in proportion to the extent of space which a cable is allowed
to occupy where it lies.</p>

<p class='c008'>FALL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garant</span></i>, the loose end of a tackle; or that part upon which
the people pull, or hoist, to produce the required effect. See the article
<span class='sc'>Tackle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Fall</span> <i>aboard</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Aboard</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Fall</span> <i>a-stern</i>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tomber en arriere</span></i>,) to be driven backwards; to retreat
with the stern foremost: expressed of the motion of a ship either under
sail or at anchor.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Fall</span> <i>calm</i>, <i>pacifier</i>, a phrase expressed of the weather, implying to
fall into a state of rest by a total cessation of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Fall</span> <i>down</i>, in navigation, to sail, or be conducted from any part
of a river, towards some other nearer to its mouth or opening.</p>

<p class='c008'>FALLING-OFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abatíe</span></i>, the movement or direction of the ship’s head
to leeward of the point whither it was lately directed, particularly
when she sails near the wind, or lies by.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cat</i> <span class='sc'>Fall</span>. See the article <span class='sc'>Cat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Falling-off</span>, is also the angle contained between her nearest approach
towards the source of the wind, and her farthest declination
from it, when <span class='sc'>Trying</span>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>FASHION-PIECES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estains</span></i>, the aft-most or hind-most timbers of a
ship, which terminate the breadth, and form the shape of the stern.
They are united to the stern-post, and to the extremity of the wing-transom
by a rabbit, and a number of strong nails, or spikes, driven
from without. See their connection with the stern post and transom,
in plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. fig. I. as explained in the article <span class='sc'>Stern</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FATHOM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bras</span></i>, a measure of six feet, used for a variety of purposes
at sea; as to regulate the length of the rigging, cables, &amp;c. and to divide
the log lines, and sounding-lines.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='fss'>FAY</span>, to fit any two pieces of wood so as to join close together. The
plank is said to fay to the timbers, when it bears, or lies, close to all
the timbers. <cite>Murray’s Ship-building.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>FENDERS, (from <i>fend</i>,) certain pieces of old cable, timber, faggots,
or other materials, hung over the side of a ship or vessel, to prevent
it from striking or rubbing against a wharf, or key: as also to preserve
the smaller vessel from being damaged by the larger ones.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> FETCH <span class='sc'>Way</span>, to be shaken or agitated from one side to another.
It is usually applied to a mast, bowsprit, &amp;c. when it is not sufficiently
wedged, being loose in the partners: it is also said of a cask, box, or
such body which moves by the rocking of the ship at sea, as not being
well secured and enclosed.</p>

<p class='c008'>FETCHING <i>the pump</i>, the act of pouring a can of water into the upper-part
of it, to expel the air which is contained between the lower box,
or piston, and the lower-end of the pump that rests upon the ship’s floor;
and accordingly to make the water, poured into the chamber, communicate
with that in the bottom of the pump-well, so as to be thrown
out above by <i>striking</i> with the brake, or handle. See <span class='sc'>Pump</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FID, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clef de ton</span></i>, a square bar of wood, or iron, with a shoulder at
one end, as represented in plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. fig. I. It is used to support the
weight of the top-mast, when erected at the head of the lower-mast, by
passing through a mortise in the lower end of the former, and resting
its ends on the tressel-trees, which are sustained by the head of the latter.
The fid, therefore, must be withdrawn every time the top-mast is
lowered. The top-gallant-mast is retained at the head of the top-mast
in the same manner. See the article <span class='sc'>Mast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fid</span>, (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fitta</span></i>, Ital.) is also a large pin of hard wood, tapering to a point,
and used for splicing of cables or large cordage.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sea</i>-FIGHT. See the article <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> FILL, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire servir</span></i>, to brace the sails in such a manner,
as that the wind, entering their cavities from behind, dilates them
so as to advance the ship in her course, after the sails had for some time
been shivering, or braced aback. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>FIRE-ARROW, a steel dart used by privateers and pirates to fire the
sails of the enemy in battle: these machines are particularly described
in the article <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FIRE-SHIP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brulot</span></i>, an old vessel filled with combustible materials,
and fitted with grappling-irons to hook, and set fire to, the enemies
ships in battle, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>As there is nothing particular in the construction of this ship, except
the apparatus by which the fire is instantly conveyed from one part to
another, and from thence to the enemy, it will be sufficient to describe
the fire-room, where these combustibles are enclosed, together with the
instruments necessary to grapple the ship intended to be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fire-room is built between-decks, and limited on the after-part by
a <i>bulk-head</i>, I, behind the main-mast, from which it extends quite forwards,
as represented in fig. 2, plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. The train enclosed in this
apartment is contained in a variety of wooden troughs, D, G, which
intersect each other in different parts of the ship’s length; being supported
at proper distances by cross-pieces and stanchions. On each side
of the ship are six or seven ports, H, about eighteen inches broad, and
fifteen inches high, and having their lids to open downward, contrary
to the usual method.</p>

<div id='IV'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/i_138.jpg'><img src='images/i_138_thumb.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i><span class='sc'>Plate. iv.</span></i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Against every port is placed an iron chamber<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a>, which, at the time
of firing the ship, blows out the port-lid, and opens a passage for the
flame. Immediately under the main and fore shrouds is fixed a wooden
funnel, M; whose lower-end communicates with a fire-barrel<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a>, by which
the flame passing through the funnel is conducted to the shrouds. Between
the funnels, which are likewise called fire-trunks, are two <i>scuttles</i>,
or small-holes in the upper-deck, serving also to let out the flames. Both
funnels must be stopped with plugs, and have sail-cloth, or canvas,
nailed close over them, to prevent any accident happening from above to
the combustibles laid below.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ports, funnels, and scuttles, not only communicate the flames to
the out-side and upper-works of the ship, and her rigging, but likewise
open a passage for the inward air, confined in the fire-room, which
is thereby expanded so as to force impetuously through those out-lets,
and prevent the blowing up of the decks, which must of necessity happen,
from such a sudden and violent rarefaction of the air as will then
be produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>On each side of the bulk-head behind is cut a hole L, of sufficient
size to admit a trough of the same dimensions as the others. A leading
trough, L I, whose foremost-end communicates with another
trough within the fire-room, is laid close to this opening, from whence
it extends obliquely to a sally-port, I, cut through the ship’s side. The
decks and troughs are well covered with melted rosin. At the time of
firing either of the leading troughs, the flame is immediately conveyed
to the opposite side of the ship, whereby both sides burn together.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spaces N, O, behind the fire-room, represent the cabins of the
lieutenant and master, one of which is on the <i>starboard</i>, and the other
on the <i>larboard</i> side. The captain’s cabin, which is separated from these
by a bulk-head, is exhibited also by P.</p>

<p class='c008'>Four of the eight fire-barrels are placed under the four fire-trunks; and

they are securely <i>cleated</i> to the deck. The longest reeds<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> are put into the
fore and aft troughs, and tied down: the shortest reeds are laid in the
troughs athwart, and tied down also. The bavins<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a>, dipped at one end,
are tied fast to the troughs over the reeds and the curtains are nailed up
to the beams, in equal quantities, on each side of the fire-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The remainder of the reeds are placed in a position nearly upright,
at all the angles of every square in the fire-room, and there tied down.

lay double quick-match<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> upon all the reeds, in all the troughs: the remainder

your bavins loose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cast off all the covers of the fire-barrels, and hang the quick-match
loose over their sides, and place leaders of quick-match from the reeds
into the barrels, and from thence into the vent of the chambers, in
such a manner as to be certain of their blowing open the ports, and setting
fire to the barrels. Two troughs of communication from each door
of the fire-room to the sally-ports, must be laid with a strong leader
of quick-match, four or five times double: also a cross-piece to go from
the sally-port, when the ship is fired, to the communication trough,
laid with leaders of quick-match, that the fire may be communicated
to both sides at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>What quick-match is left, place so that the fire may be communicated
to all parts of the room at once, especially about the ports and fire-barrels,
and see that the chambers are well and fresh primed.</p>

<p class='c008'>N. B. The port-fires<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> used for firing the ship, burns about twelve minutes.
Great care must be taken to have no powder on board when the
ship is fired.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sheer-hooks represented by fig. 3, plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. are fitted so as to
fasten on the yard-arms of the fire-ship, where they hook the enemies
rigging. The fire-grapplings, fig. 4, are either fixed on the yard-arms,
or thrown by hand, having a chain to confine the ships together, or
fasten those instruments wherever necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the commanding officer of a fleet displays the signal to prepare
for action, the fire-ships fix their sheer-hooks, and dispose their grapplings
in readiness. The battle being begun, they proceed immediately to
prime, and prepare their fire-works. When they are ready for grappling,
they inform the admiral thereof by a particular signal.</p>

<p class='c008'>To avoid being disabled by the enemy’s cannon during a general engagement,
the fire-ships continue sufficiently distant from their line of
battle, either to windward or to leeward.</p>

<p class='c008'>They cautiously shun the openings, or intervals, of the line, where
they would be directly exposed to the enemy’s fire, from which they
are covered by lying on the opposite side of their own ships. They are
attentively to observe the signals of the admiral, or his seconds, in order
to put their designs immediately in execution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although no ship of the line should be previously appointed to protect
any fire-ship, except a few of the smallest particularly destined to
this service, yet the ship before whom she passes in order to approach
the enemy, should escort her thither, and assist her with an armed boat,
or whatever succour may be necessary in her situation<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The captain of the fire-ship should himself be particularly attentive
that the above instructions are punctually executed, and that the yards
may be so braced, when he falls along-side of the ship intended to be
destroyed, that the sheer-hooks and grapplings fastened to the yardarms,
&amp;c. may effectually hook the enemy. He is expected to be the
last person who quits the vessel, and being furnished with every necessary
assistance and support, his reputation will greatly depend on the
success of his enterprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>FISH, a machine employed to hoist or draw up the flukes of the ship’s anchor
towards the top of the bow in order to stow it, after having been heaved
up by the cable. It is composed of four parts, viz. the pendant, the block,
the hook, and the tackle; which, together with their several uses, are described
in the article <span class='sc'>Davit</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fish</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jumelle</span></i>, is also a long piece of oak, convex on one side, and concave
on the other. It is used to fasten upon the outside of the lower masts, either
as an additional security, to strengthen them when it becomes necessary to
carry an extraordinary pressure of sail, in pursuit of, or flight from, an
enemy, or to reinforce them after they have received some damage in battle,
tempestuous weather, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fishes are also employed for the same purpose on any yard, which
happens to be sprung or fractured. Thus their form, application, and utility
are exactly like those of the splinters applied to a broken limb in surgery.</p>

<p class='c008'>FISH-GIG, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foesne</span></i>, an instrument used to strike fish at sea, particularly
dolphins. It consists of a staff, three or four barbed prongs, and a line
fastened to the end, on which the prongs are fixed: to the other end is fitted
a piece of lead, which serves to give additional force to the stroke when the
weapon flies, and to turn the points upward after the fish is penetrated.</p>

<p class='c008'>FITTING-OUT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">equiper</span></i>, the act of providing a ship with a sufficient
number of men, to navigate and arm her for attack or defence: also to
furnish her with proper masts, sails, yards, ammunition, artillery, cordage,
anchors, and other naval furniture; together with sufficient provisions for
the ship’s company.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLAG, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavillon</span></i>, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">flag</span></i>, Dutch) a certain banner or standard, by which
an admiral is distinguished at sea from the inferior ships of his squadron; also
the colours by which one nation is distinguished from another.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the British navy flags are either red, white, or blue, and are displayed
from the top of the main-mast, fore-mast, or mizen-mast, according to the
rank of the admiral.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first flag in Great Britain is the royal standard, which is only to be
hoisted when the king or queen are aboard the vessel: the second is that of
the anchor of hope, which characterizes the lord high admiral, or lords
commissioners of the admiralty: and the third is the union flag, in which
the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew are blended. This last is appropriated<a id='appropropriated'></a>
to the admiral of the fleet, who is the first military officer under
the lord high admiral.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a flag is displayed from the flag-staff on the main-mast, the officer
distinguished thereby, is known to be an admiral; when from the
fore-mast, a vice-admiral; and when from the mizen-mast, a rear-admiral.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next flag after the union is that of the white squadron, at the main-mast,
and the last, which characterizes an admiral, is the blue, at the same
mast-head.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a vice-admiral, the first flag is the red; the second, the white; the
third, the blue, at the flag-staff on the fore-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same order proceeds with regard to the rear-admirals, whose flags
are hoisted on the top of the mizen-mast: the lowest flag in our navy is
accordingly the blue on the mizen-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLAG-OFFICER, a term synonimous to admiral.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLAG-SHIP, the ship on which any flag is displayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLAG-STAFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baton</span></i>, a pole erected at the head of a top-gallant-mast,
or top-mast, whereon to hoist and display the flag or pendant.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLAKE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">echafaud</span></i>, a sort of scaffold or platform, formed of hurdles and
supported by stanchions, and used for drying cod-fish in Newfoundland.
These flakes are usually placed near the shores of fishing-harbours.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLAT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plain</span></i>, a level ground lying at a small depth under the surface of
the sea, and otherwise called a shoal or shallow.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Flat-in</span>, the action of drawing in the aftmost lower-corner, or
clue of a sail towards the middle of the ship, to give the sail the greater
power of turning the vessel. Thus if the mizen, or after-sails are flatted-in, it is
evident that the intention is to carry the stern to leeward, and turn the head
nearer to the direction of the wind: and if the head-sails are slatted-in,
the intention is accordingly to make the ship <i>fall off</i>, when by design or
accident she has come so near the wind as to make the sails shiver. Hence</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Flat-in forward</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traverse misaine</span></i>, is the order to draw in the fore-sheet,
jib-sheet, and fore-stay-sail-sheet, towards the middle of the ship.
This operation is seldom performed, except in light breezes of wind, when
the helm has not sufficient government of the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLEET, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vaisseaux du roi</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">flota</span></i>, Sax.) a general name given to his majesty’s
navy, or to any part thereof destined on a particular enterprise or
expedition: also a convoy or company of merchant ships, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flotte</span></i>, <i>conserve</i>, with
or without ships of war to defend them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The admirals of his majesty’s fleet are classed into three squadrons, viz.
the red, the white, and the blue. When any of these officers are invested
with the command of a squadron or detachment of men of war, the particular
ships are distinguished by the colours of their respective squadron: that is to
say, the ships of the red squadron wear an ensign, whose union is displayed
on a red field; the ensigns of the white squadron have a white field; and
those of the blue squadron, a blue field; the union being common to all
three. The ships of war therefore are occasionally annexed to any of the
three squadrons, or shifted from one to another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of whatsoever number a fleet of ships of war is composed, it is usually
divided into three squadrons; and these, if numerous, are again separated
into divisions. The admiral, or principal officer, commands the centre;
the vice-admiral, or second in command, superintends the van-guard; and
the operations of the rear are directed by the rear-admiral, or the officer
next in rank. See the article <span class='sc'>Division</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The disposition of a fleet, while proceeding on a voyage, will in some
measure depend on particular circumstances; as the difficulty of the navigation;
the necessity of dispatch, according to the urgency or importance of
the expedition; or the expectation of an enemy in the passage. The most
convenient order is probably to range it into three lines or columns, each of
which is parallel to a line close-hauled according to the tack, on which the
line of battle is designed to be formed. This arrangement is more used
than any, because it contains the advantages of every other form, without
their inconveniences. The fleet being thus more inclosed, will more readily
observe the signals, and with greater facility form itself into the line of battle;
a circumstance which should be kept in view in every order of sailing.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLEETING, the act of changing the situation of a tackle, when the
blocks are drawn together; or what is called <i>block and block</i> by sailors. The
use of fleeting is accordingly to replace the mechanical powers into a state
of action; the force by which they operated before being destroyed by the
meeting of the blocks or pullies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fleeting therefore is nearly similar to the winding up of a watch or clock.
See the article <span class='sc'>Tackle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLOAT, a raft, or quantity of timber fastened together across, to be
wafted along a river with the tide or current.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLOATING, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flotter</span></i>, Fr.) the state of being borne up, or wafted along
with the tide on the surface of the water, the theory of which is explained
in the article Trim.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLOOR, the bottom of a ship; or all that part on each side of the keel,
which approaches nearer to an horizontal, than a perpendicular situation,
and whereon she rests when aground. Thus it is common to say, a sharp
floor, a flat floor, a long floor, &amp;c. Whence</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Floor-timbers</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">varangues</span></i>, are those parts of the ship’s timbers which
are placed immediately across the keel, and upon which the bottom of the ship
is framed: to these the upper parts of the <i>timbers</i> are united, being only
a continuation of floor-timbers upwards. See <i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLOWING, the position of the <i>sheets</i>, or lower corners of the principal
sails, when they are loosened to the wind, so as to receive it into their
cavities in a direction more nearly perpendicular than when they are <i>close-hauled</i>,
although more obliquely than when the vessel is sailing before the
wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship is therefore said to have a flowing sheet when the wind crosses the
line of her course nearly at right angles: that is to say, a ship steering due
north, with the wind at east, or directly on her side, will have a flowing sheet;
whereas if the sheets were extended close aft, she would sail two points
nearer the wind, viz. N. N. E. See the articles <span class='sc'>Close-hauled</span>, <span class='sc'>Large</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Trim</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLY <i>of an ensign</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">battant</span></i>, the breadth or extent from the staff to the
extremity or edge that flutters loose in the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>FLY-BOAT, or FLIGHT, a large flat-bottomed Dutch vessel, whose
burthen is generally from four to six hundred tons. It is distinguished by
a stern remarkably high, resembling a Gothic turret, and by very broad
buttocks below.</p>

<p class='c008'>FOOT <i>of a sail</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fond de voile</span></i>, lower edge or bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Foot-rope</span>, the rope to which the foot of a sail is sewed. See <span class='sc'>Bolt-Rope</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Foot-ropes</span> are also the same with horses of the yards. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>FOOT-WALEING, the whole inside planks or lining of a ship, used
to prevent any part of the ballast or cargo from falling between the floor-timbers.
See <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FORE, the distinguishing character of all that part of a ship’s frame and
machinery which lies near the stem.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fore and Aft</span>, throughout the ship’s whole length, or from end to end.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fore Bowline</span>, the bowline of the fore-sail. See <span class='sc'>Bowline</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fore-castle</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaillard d’avant</span></i>, a short deck placed in the fore part of
the ship, above the upper deck. It is usually terminated, both before
and behind, by a breast-work in vessels of war; the foremost end forming
the top of the <i>beak-head</i>, and the hind part reaching to the after part of the
fore-chains.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fore-cat-harpings</span>, a complication of ropes used to brace in the upper
part of the fore-shrouds. See <span class='sc'>Cat-harpings</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fore-foot</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brion</span></i>, a piece of timber which terminates the keel at the
fore end. It is connected by a scarf to the extremity of the keel, of which
it makes a part: and the other end of it, which is incurvated upwards into a
sort of knee or crotch, is attached to the lower end of the stem, of which
it also makes a part, being also called the <i>gripe</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the lower arm of the fore-foot lies on the same level with the keel, so
the upper one coincides with the middle line of the stem: its breadth and
thickness therefore correspond to the dimensions of those pieces, and the
heel of the cut-water is scarfed to its upper end.</p>

<p class='c008'>The form of this piece, and its disposition and connexion with the adjacent
pieces, appears by the letter <i>i</i>, in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces of the Hull</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fore-Hooks</span>, the same with breast-hooks, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Foreland</span>, a cape or promontory projecting into the sea; as the North or
South Forelands.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fore-Lock</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clavette</span></i>, a little flat-pointed wedge of iron, used to drive
through a hole in the end of a bolt, to retain it firmly in its place.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fore-reaching upon</span>, the act of advancing before, or gaining ground
of, some other ship or ships in company.</p>

<p class='c008'>FORGING OVER, the act of forcing a ship violently over a shoal, by

<p class='c008'>FOTHERING, a peculiar method of endeavouring to stop a leak in the
bottom of a ship while she is afloat, either under sail or at anchor. It is
usually performed in the following manner: a basket is filled with ashes,
cinders, and chopped rope-yarns, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonette lardeé</span></i>, and loosely covered with a
piece of canvas; to this is fastened a long pole, by which it is plunged repeatedly
in the water, as close as possible to the place where the leak is
conjectured to lie. The oakum, or chopped rope-yarns, being thus gradually
shaken through the twigs, or over the top of the basket, are frequently
sucked into the hole along with the water, so that the leak becomes
immediately choaked, and the future entrance of the water is thereby
prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>FOUL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empecheé</span></i>, as a sea-term, is generally used in opposition to clear,
and implies intangled, embarrassed, or contrary, in the following senses:</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship ran foul of us in the river, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> entangled herself amongst our
rigging.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Foul</span>, when expressed of a ship’s bottom, denotes that it is very dirty; as
being covered with grass, sea-weeds, shells, or other filth which gathers to it
during the course of a long voyage. When understood of the ground or
bottom of a road, bay, sea-coast, or harbour, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal sain</span></i>, it signifies rocky, or
abounding with shallows, or otherwise dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>When spoken of the hawse, it means that the cables are turned round
each other, by the winding or turning about of the ship while she rides at
anchor. See <span class='sc'>Elbow</span> and <span class='sc'>Hawse</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Foul</span>, when applied to the wind, is used to express that it is unfavourable,
or contrary to the ship’s course, as opposed to <i>large</i> or <i>fair</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> FOUNDER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sancir</span></i>, to sink at sea, as being rendered, by the violence
and continuation of a storm, and the excess of the leaks, unable to keep the
ship afloat above the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>FOX, a sort of <i>strand</i>, formed by twisting several rope-yarns together,
and used as a <i>seizing</i>, or to weave a <i>mat</i> or <i>paunch</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>FRAME. See <span class='sc'>Timber</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FRAPPING, the act of crossing and drawing together the several parts of
a tackle, or other complication of ropes, which had already been straitened to
their utmost extent: in this sense it exactly resembles the operation of bracing
up a drum, &amp;c. The frapping always increases the tension, and of course
adds to the security acquired by the purchase. Hence the cat-harpings are
no other than frappings to the shrouds.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Frapping</span> <i>a ship</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ceintrer</span></i>, the act of passing three, four, or five turns of a
cable round the hull, or frame of a ship, in the middle, to support her in a
great storm, when it is apprehended that she is not strong enough to resist
the violent efforts of the sea. This expedient however is rarely put in
practice, unless in very old ships, which their owners are willing to venture
to sea as long as possible, by ensuring them deeply.</p>

<p class='c008'>FREEING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affranchir</span></i>, the act of pumping, or otherwise throwing out
the water which has leaked into a ship’s bottom at sea, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>FREEZING, a sort of ornamental painting on the upper part of a ship’s
<i>quarter</i>, <i>stern</i>, or <i>bow</i>. It consists generally of armour, instruments of war,
marine emblems, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>FREIGHT, or <i>fraight of a ship</i> (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affretement</span></i>) the hire, or a part thereof,
usually paid for the carriage and conveyance of goods; or the sum agreed,
upon between the owner and the merchant for the hire and use of a vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Freight</span> also implies the lading or cargo which she has aboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>FRESH, when applied to the wind, generally signifies strong, but not
violent or dangerous: hence when the gale increases, it is said to freshen.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> FRESHEN <i>the hawse</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">refraichir</span></i>, to relieve that part of the cable
which for some time has been exposed to the friction in one of the <i>hawse-holes</i>,
produced by the rocking and pitching of a ship as she rides at anchor
in a high sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship remains in such a situation, it is always necessary to wrap
some old canvas, mat, leather, or such like material, round that part of the
cable which rubs against the <i>stem</i>, &amp;c. The matter used for this purpose
is called <i>service</i>: but as the violent agitation of the ship, produced by the
tempest, or sea, as she rides in an open road, must communicate a great
friction to the cable, the service will consequently be soon worn through: it
is necessary therefore to have it frequently renewed by a fresh application of
the like materials, behind the former, for the preservation of the cable, on
which every thing depends; and this renewal of service is called <i>freshening
the hawse</i>, a circumstance which cannot be too vigilantly observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>FRESHES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souberme</span></i>, imply the impetuosity of an ebb-tide, increased by
heavy rains, and flowing out into the sea, which it often discolours to a
considerable distance from the shore; inasmuch as the line, which divides the
two colours, may be perceived distinctly for a great length along the coast.</p>

<p class='c008'>FRIGATE, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fregate</span></i>, Fr.) in the navy, a light nimble ship built for the
purposes of sailing swiftly. These vessels mount from twenty to thirty-eight
guns, and are esteemed excellent cruizers.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Frigate-built</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fregaté</span></i>, implies the disposition of the decks of such
merchant ships as have a descent of four or five steps from the <i>quarter-deck</i>
and <i>fore-castle</i> into the <i>waist</i>, in contra-distinction to those whose decks are on
a continued line for the whole length of the ship, which are called <i>galley-built</i>.

<p class='c008'>Formerly the name of frigate was only known in the Mediterranean, and
applied to a kind of long vessel, navigated in that sea with sails and oars.
The English were the first who appeared on the ocean with those ships, and
equipped them for war as well as commerce.</p>

<p class='c008'>FULL AND BY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pres &amp; plein</span></i>, the situation of a ship with regard to
the wind, when she is close-hauled, and sailing in such a manner as neither to
steer too nigh the direction of the wind, nor to deviate to leeward; both of
which movements are unfavourable to her course, as in the former her sails
will shiver, and render the effort of the wind precarious and ineffectual; and
in the latter she will advance in a direction widely distant from her real
course. Hence, keep her full! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">defie du vent!</span></i> is the order from the pilot or
other officer to the helmsman, not to incline too much to windward,
and thereby shake the sails so as to retard the course.</p>

<p class='c008'>FURLING, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ferler</span></i>, Fr.) the operation of wrapping or rolling a sail
close up to the <i>yard</i>, <i>stay</i>, or <i>mast</i> to which it belongs, and winding a gasket
or cord about it to fasten it thereto. And hence</p>

<p class='c008'>FURLING-LINE denotes a cord employed in this office: those which
are used for the larger sails are generally flat, and are known by the name of
<i>gaskets</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>FUTTOCKS, the middle division of a ship’s timbers; or those parts
which are situated between the <i>floor</i> and the top-timbers. See this fully
explained in the article <span class='sc'>Timber</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the epithet <i>hooked</i> is frequently applied in common language to any
thing bent or incurvated, and particularly to several crooked timbers in a
ship, as the <i>breast-hooks</i>, <i>fore-hooks</i>, <i>after-hooks</i>, &amp;c. this term is evidently
derived from the lowest part or <i>foot</i> of the timber, and from the shape of
the piece. Hence</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Futtock-Shrouds</span>, or rather <span class='sc'>Foot-hook Shrouds</span>. See the article
<span class='sc'>Shrouds</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>G.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>GAFF, a sort of boom or pole, frequently used in small ships, to
extend the upper edge of the mizen; and always employed for the
same purpose on those sails whose foremost edges are joined to the mast by
hoops or lacings, and which are usually extended by a <i>boom</i> below. Such
are the main-sails of all sloops, brigs, and schooners.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foremost, or inner extremity of the gaff, is furnished with two cheeks
forming a semi-circle, which incloses the after-part of the mast so as to confine
the gaff close to its respective mast whilst the sail is hoisting or lowering.
It is further secured in this situation by a rope passing from one of the
cheeks to the other on the fore side of the mast; and to prevent the friction
of this rope upon the mast, by hoisting or lowering, several little wooden
balls, called <i>trucks</i>, are hung upon it, in the same manner as the holy beads
are hung upon a catholic’s rosary.</p>

<p class='c008'>GAGE. See <span class='sc'>Weather-Gage</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> GAIN <i>the wind</i>, in navigation, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gagner au vent</span></i>, to arrive on the weather-side,
or to windward of, some other vessel in sight, when both are plying to
windward, or sailing as near the wind as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>GALE <i>of wind</i>, a phrase used by sailors to express a storm or tempest. It
is more particularly termed a hard gale, or strong gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>GALEON, a name formerly given to ships of war, furnished with three
or four batteries of cannon. It is now retained only by the Spaniards, and
applied to the largest size of their merchant ships, employed on West-Indian
voyages, and usually furnished with four decks. They likewise bestow the same
name on those vessels, whether great or small, which proceed annually to La
Vera Cruz. The Portugueze also have several ships which they send to India
and the Brazils, nearly resembling the galeons, and by them called <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caragues</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GALLED, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raqué</span></i>, the state of a mast, yard, cable, or other rope, when
it is deprived of the surface, and chafed by friction. To preserve those
articles from being damaged by this effect, it is therefore usual to cover
them with skins, mats, canvas, or such materials, in the places where they
are the most exposed to it by the rocking of the vessel. See the article
<span class='sc'>Service</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GALLERY, a balcony projecting from the <i>stern</i> or <i>quarter</i> of a ship of
war, or large merchantman. In the former, the stern-gallery is usually
decorated with a ballustrade, extending from one side of the ship to the other;
the fore-part is limited by a partition called the skreen-bulk head, in which
are framed the cabin windows; and the roof of it is formed by a sort of
vault, termed the <i>cove</i>, which is frequently ornamented with sculpture. See
<span class='sc'>Stern</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The quarter gallery of a ship of 74 guns is represented at large, in the
plate referred to from the article <span class='sc'>Quarter</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GALLEY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galere</span></i>, a kind of low flat-built vessel, furnished with one
deck, and navigated with sails and oars, particularly in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c008'>The largest sort of these vessels, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galeasse</span></i>, is employed only by the Venetians.
They are commonly 162 feet long above, and 133 feet by the
keel; 32 feet wide, with 23 feet length of stern-post. They are furnished
with three masts, and thirty-two banks of oars; every bank containing two
oars, and every oar being managed by six or seven slaves, who are usually
chained thereto. In the fore-part they have three little batteries of cannon,
of which the lowest is of two 36 pounders, the second of two 24 pounders, and
the uppermost of two 2 pounders: three 18 pounders are also planted on
each quarter. The compliment of men for one of these galleys is generally
1000 or 1200. They are esteemed extremely convenient for bombarding
or making a descent upon an enemy’s coast, as drawing but little water;
and having by their oars frequently the advantage of a ship of war, in
light winds or calms, by cannonading the latter near the surface of the water;
by scouring her whole length with their shot, and at the same time keeping
on her quarter or bow, so as to be out of the direction of her cannon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gallies next in size to these, which are also called half-gallies, are
from 120 to 130 feet long, 18 feet broad, and 9 or 10 feet deep. They
have two masts, which may be struck at pleasure, and are furnished with
two large lateen sails, and five pieces of cannon. They have commonly 25
banks of oars, as described above. A size still less than these are called
quarter-gallies, carrying from twelve to sixteen banks of oars. There are
very few gallies now besides those in the Mediterranean, which are found by
experience to be of little utility, except in fine weather; a circumstance which
renders their service extremely precarious. They generally keep close under
the shore, but sometimes venture out to sea to perform a summer cruise.
See the articles <span class='sc'>Quarter</span> and <span class='sc'>Vessel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GAMMONING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lieure</span></i>, a rope used to bind the inner quarter of the
bowsprit close down to the ship’s stem, in order to enable it the better to
support the stays of the fore-mast, and carry sail in the fore part of the vessel.
Seven or eight turns of this rope, fig. 7. plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. are passed over the bowsprit
A, and through a large hole in the stem or knee of the head Y alternately:
after all the turns are drawn as firm as possible, the opposite ones are
braced together under the bowsprit by a <i>frapping</i>, as exhibited in the same
figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>GANG, a select number of a ship’s crew appointed on any particular
service, and commanded by an officer suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>GANG-BOARD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">planche</span></i>, a board or plank with several cleats or steps
nailed upon it for the convenience of walking into, or out of, a boat upon the
shore, where the water is not deep enough to float the boat close to the
landing-place.</p>

<p class='c008'>GANGWAY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passe-avant</span></i>, a narrow platform, or range of planks, laid
horizontally along the upper part of a ship’s side, from the quarter-deck to
the forecastle, for the convenience of walking more expeditiously, <i>fore and
aft</i>, than by descending into the waist. This platform is therefore peculiar
to ships which are <i>deep-waisted</i>. It is fenced on the outside by several small
iron pillars, and a rope extended from one to the other; and sometimes by a
netting, to prevent any one from falling off into the sea when the ship is in
motion. This is frequently called the gang-board in merchant vessels.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Gangway</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">echelle</span></i>, is also that part of a ship’s side, both within and without,
by which the passengers enter and depart. It is for this purpose provided
with a sufficient number of steps, or <i>cleats</i>, nailed upon the ship’s side,
nearly as low as the surface of the water; and sometimes furnished with a
railed accommodation-ladder, whose lower end projects from the ship’s side,
being secured in this position by iron braces, so as to render the ascent and
descent extremely convenient.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Gangway</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accoursie</span></i>, is likewise used to signify a passage left in the hold,
when a ship is laden, in order to arrive at any particular place therein, occasionally;
as to examine the situation of the provisions or cargo; to discover
and stop a leak; or to bring out any article required for service; &amp;c.
Finally, a gangway implies a thoroughfare, or narrow passage of any kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>GARLAND, a sort of net, whose opening is extended by a wooden hoop
of sufficient size to admit a bowl or platter within it. It is accordingly
used by the sailors as a locker or cupboard to contain their provisions, being
hung up to the deck within the <i>birth</i>, where they commonly mess between-decks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Shot</i>-<span class='sc'>Garland</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">epitie</span></i>, a piece of timber nailed horizontally along the
ship’s side from one gun-port to another, and used to contain the round-shot
ready for charging the great guns in battle. For this purpose it is furnished
with several semi-globular cavities, corresponding to the size of the cannon-balls
which it is employed to contain.</p>

<p class='c008'>GARNET, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garant</span></i>, a sort of tackle fixed to the main-stay of a merchant
ship, and used to hoist in and out the goods of which the cargo is composed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Garnet</span> is also a small tackle fastened to the clues or lower corners of
the main-sail or fore-sail, for the purpose of trussing up those sails, as occasion
requires; and hence it is called <span class='sc'>Clue-Garnet</span>, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>GARBOARD-STREAK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gabord</span></i>, in ship-building, the first range or <i>streak</i>
of planks laid upon a ship’s bottom next to the keel, throughout the whole
length of the floor. The edge of this plank is let into a groove or channel
in the side of the keel, which is called the rabbit of the garboard-streak.</p>

<p class='c008'>GASKET, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garcet</span></i>, a sort of platted cord fastened to the sail-yards of a
ship, and used to <i>furl</i> or tie up the sail firmly to the yard. This is performed
by wrapping the gasket round the yard and sail six or seven times,
the turns being at a competent distance from each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>GAUNTLOPE, pronounced gauntlet, a race which a criminal is sentenced
to run in a vessel of war, as a punishment for felony, or some other
heinous offence.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is executed in the following manner: the whole ship’s crew is disposed
in two rows, standing face to face on both sides of the deck, so as to form
a lane, whereby to go <i>forward</i> on one side, and return <i>aft</i> on the other; each
person being furnished with a small twisted cord, called a knittle, having
two or three knots upon it. The delinquent is then stripped naked above the
waist, and ordered to pass forward between the two rows of men, and aft on
the other side, a certain number of times, rarely exceeding three; during which
every person gives him a stripe as he runs along. In his passage through this
painful ordeal he is sometimes tripped up, and very severely handled while
incapable of proceeding. This punishment, which is called <i>running the
gauntlet</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courir la bouline</span></i>, is seldom inflicted except for such crimes as will
naturally excite a general antipathy amongst the seamen; as on some occasions
the culprit would pass without receiving a single blow, particularly in
cases of mutiny or sedition, to the punishment of which, our common sailors
seem to have a constitutional aversion.</p>

<p class='c008'>GEARS. See <span class='sc'>Jears</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GIMBALS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balanciers</span></i>, the brass rings by which a sea-compass is suspended
in its box that usually stands in the binacle. See the article <span class='sc'>Binacle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GIMBLETING, a term particularly applied to the anchor, to denote the
action of turning it round by the stock, so that the motion of the stock
appears similar to that of the handle of a gimblet, when it is employed to
turn the wire.</p>

<p class='c008'>GIRT, the situation of a ship which is moored so strait by her cables,
extending from the <i>hause</i> to two distant anchors, as to be prevented from
swinging or turning about, according to any change of the wind or tide,
to the current of which her head would otherwise be directed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cables are extended in this manner, by a strong application of mechanical
powers within the ship; so that as she veers, or endeavours to swing
about, her side bears upon one of the cables, which catches on her heel, and
interrupts her in the act of traversing. In this position she must ride with
her broadside or stern to the wind or current, till one or both of the cables
are slackened so as to sink under the keel; after which the ship will readily
yield to the effort of the wind or current, and turn her head thither. See
the article <span class='sc'>Riding</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GIRT-LINE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cartahu</span></i>, a rope passing through a single block, on the
head of the lower masts, to hoist up the rigging thereof; as also the persons
employed to place the rigging and cross-trees upon the mast-heads. The
girt-line is therefore the first rope employed to rig a ship, and by means of
this all the rest are drawn up and fixed; after which it is removed till the
ship is to be unrigged.</p>

<p class='c008'>GONDOLA, a sort of <i>barge</i>, curiously ornamented, and navigated on the
canals of Venice; also a passage-boat of six or eight oars, in other parts of
the coast of Italy.</p>

<p class='c008'>GOOGINGS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femelles</span></i>, certain clamps of iron bolted on the stern-post of
a ship, whereon to hang the rudder, and keep it steddy; for which purpose
there is a hole in each of them, to receive a correspondent spindle bolted on
the back of the rudder, which turns thereby as upon hinges. There are
generally four, five, or six googings on a ship’s stern-post and rudder, according
to her size, and upon these the rudder is supported, and traverses
from side to side as upon an axis. See <span class='sc'>Helm</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GOOSE-NECK, a sort of iron hook fitted on the inner end of a boom,
and introduced into a clamp of iron, or eye-bolt, which encircles the mast,
or is fitted to some other place in the ship, so that it may be unhooked at pleasure.
See <span class='sc'>Boom</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GOOSE-WINGS <i>of a sail</i>, the clues or lower corners of a ship’s main-sail,
or fore-sail, when the middle part is furled or tied up to the yard.</p>

<p class='c008'>The goose-wings are only used in a great storm to scud before the wind,
when the sail at large, or even diminished by a <i>reef</i>, would be too great
a pressure on the ship, in that situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>GORING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">langue</span></i>, that part of the skirts of a sail, where it gradually
widens from the upper part or head, towards the bottom: the goring-cloths
are therefore those, which are cut obliquely, and added to the breadth. See
Sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>GRAPPLING, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grapin</span></i>, Fr.) a sort of small anchor, fitted with four or
five flukes or claws, plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. fig. 5. and commonly used to ride a boat
or other small vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fire</i>-<span class='sc'>Grappling</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grapin d’abordage</span></i>, an instrument nearly resembling the
former, but differing in the construction of its flukes, which are furnished
with strong barbs on their points, fig. 4. plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. These machines are
usually fixed on the yard-arms of a ship, in order to grapple any adversary
whom she intends to board. They are however more particularly useful in
<i>fire-ships</i>, for the purposes described in that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>GRATINGS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caillebotis</span></i>, a sort of open covers for the hatches, formed
by several small laths or battens of wood, which cross each other at right
angles, leaving a square interval between. They are formed to admit the
air and light from above into the lower apartments of the ship, particularly
when the turbulence of the sea or weather renders it necessary to shut the
ports between decks; and also to let the smoke escape from the lower decks
in the time of battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>GRAVING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oeuvres de marée</span></i>, the act of cleaning a ship’s bottom when she
is laid aground during the recess of the tide. See the article <span class='sc'>Breaming</span>,
where this operation is particularly explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>GRIPES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haubans de chaloupe</span></i>, a machine formed by an assemblage of
ropes, hooks, and <i>dead-eyes</i>, and used to secure the boats upon the deck of
a ship at sea, and prevent them from being shaken by the labouring of the
vessel. The hooks, which are fastened at their ends, are fixed in ring-bolts
in the deck on each side of the boat; whence, passing over her middle
and extremities, they are extended by means of the dead-eyes, so as to render
the boats as firm and secure as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Griping</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ardent</span></i>, the inclination of a ship to run to windward of her
course, particularly when she sails with the wind on her beam or quarter.
This effect is partly occasioned by the shock of the waves that strike the ship
perpetually on the weather-quarter, and force the stern to leeward; but
chiefly by the arrangement of the sails, which disposes the ship continually
to edge to windward, while in this situation of sailing.</p>

<p class='c008'>GROMMET, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">daillot</span></i>, a sort of small wreath, formed of a <i>strand</i> of rope,
and used to fasten the upper edge of a stay-sail to its respective stay, in
different places. By means of the grommets, the sail is accordingly hoisted
or lowered, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> drawn up or down upon its stay, in the same manner as
a curtain is extended or drawn along upon its rod, by the assistance of rings.
See also the article <span class='sc'>Hank</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GROUNDING, the act of laying a ship ashore, in order to bream or
repair her. It is also applied to running aground accidentally when under
sail, or driving in a tempest.</p>

<p class='c008'>GROUND-TACKLE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amarrages</span></i>, a general name given to all sorts of
ropes and furniture which belong to the anchors, or which are employed in
mooring, or otherwise securing a ship in a road or harbour; as cables,
hausers, tow-lines, warps, and buoy-ropes.</p>

<p class='c008'>GROWING, implies the direction of the cable from the ship towards the
anchors; as, the cable grows on the starboard-bow, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> stretches out forwards
on the starboard, or right side.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUARD-BOAT, a boat appointed to row the rounds amongst the ships
of war which are laid up in any harbour, &amp;c. to observe that their officers
keep a good look-out, calling to the guard-boat as she passes, and not
suffering her crew to come aboard, without having previously communicated:
the watch-word of the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUARD-IRONS, certain curved or arched bars of iron placed over the
ornamental figures, on a ship’s head or quarter, to defend them from the
impression of some other ship when they lie close to, or rub against each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUARD-SHIP, a vessel of war appointed to superintend the marine
affairs in a harbour or river, and to see that the ships, which are not commissioned,
have their proper watch kept duly, by sending her guard-boats around
them every night: she is also to receive seamen who are impressed in the
time of war.</p>

<p class='c008'>GULF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">golfe</span></i>, (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">golfo</span></i>, Ital.) a broad and capacious bay, comprehended between
two promontories, and sometimes taking the name of a sea, when it is
very extensive, but particularly when it only communicates with the sea by
means of a streight: such are the Euxine, or Black Sea, otherwise called
the gulf of Constantinople; the Adriatic Sea, called also the gulf of Venice;
the gulf of Sidra near Barbary, and the gulf of Lions near France:
all these gulfs are in the Mediterranean: there are besides the gulf of Mexico,
the gulf of St. Lawrence, and the gulf of Calliphornia, which are in North
America. There are also the gulf of Persia, otherwise called the Red Sea,
between Persia and Arabia; the gulf of Bengal in India, and the gulfs of
Cochinchina and Kamtschatca, near the countries of the same name.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUNNEL, or GUN-WALE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plat-bord</span></i>, the upper edge of a ship’s side.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUNNER <i>of a ship of war</i>, an officer appointed to take charge of the
artillery and ammunition aboard; to observe that the former are always kept
in order, and properly fitted with tackles and other furniture, and to teach the
sailors the exercise of the cannon. See <span class='sc'>Exercise</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUN-ROOM, an apartment on the after end of the lower, or gun-deck,
of a ship of war; generally destined for the use of the gunner in large
ships, but in small ones, it is used by the lieutenants as a dining-room,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUST, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dragon de vent</span></i>, a sudden and violent squall of wind, bursting
from the hills upon the sea, so as to endanger the shipping near the shore.
These are peculiar to some coasts, as those of South Barbary and Guinea.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUTTER-LEDGE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traversier d’ecoutille</span></i>, a cross-bar laid along the middle
of a large hatchway in some vessels, to support the covers, and enable
them the better to sustain any weighty body which may be moved or laid
thereon.</p>

<p class='c008'>GUY, a rope used to steddy any weighty body whilst it is hoisting or
lowering, particularly when the ship is shaken by a tempestuous sea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Guy</span> is likewise a large slack rope, extending from the head of the main-mast
to the head of the fore-mast, and having two or three large blocks
fastened to the middle of it. This is chiefly employed to sustain the tackle
used to hoist in and out the cargo of a merchant ship, and is accordingly
removed from the mast-heads as soon as the vessel is laden or delivered.</p>

<p class='c008'>GYBING, the act of shifting any boom-sail from one side of the mast to
the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to understand this operation more clearly, it is necessary to remark,
that by a boom-sail is meant any sail whose bottom is extended by a
<i>boom</i>, the fore-end of which is hooked to its respective mast, so as to swing
occasionally on either side of the vessel, describing an arch, of which the
mast will be the center. As the wind or the course changes, it also becomes
frequently necessary to change the position of the boom, together with its
sail, which is accordingly shifted to the other side of the vessel as a door
turns upon its hinges. The boom is pushed out by the effort of the wind
upon the sail, and is restrained in a proper situation by a strong <i>tackle</i> communicating
with the vessel’s stern, and called the <i>sheet</i>. It is also confined
on the fore-part by another tackle, called the <i>guy</i>. See the preceding
article.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>H.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>HAGS TEETH, or <span class='sc'>Hakes Teeth</span>, those parts of a <i>matting</i>,
<i>pointing</i>, &amp;c. which are interwoven with the rest, in an erroneous and
irregular manner, so as to appear aukward in the general uniformity of the
work. See <span class='sc'>Pointing</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>HAILING, the salutation or accosting of a ship at a distance, either at
sea or in a harbour. The usual expression is, Hoa, the ship ahoay! To
which she answers, Holloa! Whence came ye? Where are ye bound?
Good voyage! What cheer? All well! How fare ye? &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>HALIARDS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">drisse</span></i>, the ropes or tackles usually employed to hoist or
lower any sail upon its respective masts or stay. See also <span class='sc'>Jears</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HAMMOC, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">branle</span></i>, a piece of canvas, six feet long and three feet wide,
gathered or drawn together at the two ends, and hung horizontally under
the deck, lengthways, for the sailors to sleep therein. There are usually
from fourteen to twenty inches in breadth allowed between decks for every
hammoc in a ship of war: this space however must in some measure depend
on the number of the crew, &amp;c. in proportion to the room of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the time of battle the hammocs, together with their bedding, are all
firmly corded, and fixed in the nettings on the quarter-deck, or where-ever
the men are too much exposed to the view, or fire of the enemy. See
the article <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HANDING <i>the sails</i>, the same operation with furling them, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>HAND-OVER-HAND! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">main avant!</span></i> the order to the men, who pull
upon any rope, to pass their hands alternately one before the other, or one
above the other, if they are hoisting, in order to hasten the service.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sailor is said to go aloft, hand-over-hand, when he ascends into the
tops, &amp;c. by a single rope, as a shroud or back-stay, without the help of
the <i>rattlings</i>, by the dexterity of throwing one hand above the other, and
lifting his weight along with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>HANDSPEC, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anspec</span></i>, a wooden bar used as a lever to heave about the
windlass, in order to draw up the anchor from the bottom, particularly in
merchant ships: for this purpose the handle or small end is round and tapering;
and the other end is square, in order to conform to the shape of the
holes in the windlass. It is also employed as a lever on many other occasions,
as stowing the anchors, or provisions, or cargo, in the ship’s hold.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Gunner’s</i> <span class='sc'>Handspec</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">renard</span></i>, an handspec shorter and flatter than the
above, and armed with two claws, for the purpose of managing the artillery
in battle, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>HANK for HANK</span>, a phrase expressed of two ships which <i>tack</i> and
make a progress to windward together. The Dolphin and Cerberus turned
up the river <i>hank for hank</i>, without being able to get to windward of each
other.</p>

<p class='c008'>HANKS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">daillots</span></i>, certain wooden rings fixed upon the stays of a ship, whereby
to confine the stay-sails thereto at different heights. They are used in the
place of <i>grommets</i>, being a later invention and much more convenient; because,
being framed by the bending of a tough piece of wood into the form
of a wreath, and fastened at the two ends by means of notches, they retain
their circular figure and elasticity; whereas the grommets, which are formed
of rope, are apt to relax in warm weather and adhere to the stays, so
as to prevent the sails from being readily hoisted or lowered.</p>

<p class='c008'>HARBOUR, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">havre</span></i>, a general name given to any sea-port or haven; as
also to any place convenient for mooring shipping, although at a great
distance from the sea. The qualities requisite in a good harbour are, that
the bottom be entirely free from rocks or shallows; that the opening be of
sufficient extent to admit the entrance or departure of large ships, without
difficulty; that it should have good anchoring-ground, and be easy of access;
that it should be well defended from the violence of the wind and sea;
that it should have room and convenience to receive the shipping of different
nations, and those which are laden with different merchandizes; that it be
furnished with a good light-house, and have variety of proper rings, posts,
moorings, &amp;c. in order to remove or secure the vessels contained therein: and
finally, that it have plenty of wood, and other materials for firing, besides
hemp, iron, mariners, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>HARD-A-LEE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barre à bord</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous le vent</span></i>, the situation of the helm when
it is pushed close to the <i>lee</i> side of the ship, either to <i>tack</i> or keep her head
to the wind, when lying by or <i>trying</i>: also the order to put the helm in this
position.</p>

<p class='c008'>HARD-A-WEATHER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrive tout</span></i>, the order to put the helm close
to the weather or windward side of the ship, in order to bear away. It is
likewise the position of the helm, in consequence of that order; being in
both senses opposed to <i>hard-a-lee</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HARPINGS, the fore-parts of the wales which encompass the bow of a
ship, and are fastened to the stem, being thicker than the after part of the
wales, in order to reinforce the ship in this place, where she sustains the
greatest shock of resistance in plunging into the sea, or dividing it, under a
great pressure of sail.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cat</i>-<span class='sc'>Harpings</span>. See <span class='sc'>Cat-Harpings</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HARPOON, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">harpon</span></i>, Fr.) a spear or javelin used to strike the whales in
the Greenland fishery.</p>

<p class='c008'>The harpoon, which is sometimes called the harping-iron, is furnished
with a long staff, having at one end a broad and flat triangular head, sharpened
at both edges, so as to penetrate the whale with facility: to the head of
this weapon is fastened a long cord, called the whale-line, which lies carefully
<i>coiled</i> in the boat, in such a manner, as to run out without being
interrupted or intangled. As soon as the boat has rowed within a competent
distance of the whale, the harponeer launches his instrument; and the fish,
being wounded, immediately descends under the ice with amazing rapidity,
carrying the harpoon along with him, and a considerable length of the line.
Being soon exhausted with the fatigue and loss of blood, he re-ascends in
order to breathe, where he presently expires, and floats upon the surface of
the water, when they approach the carcase by drawing in the whale-line.</p>

<p class='c008'>HATCH, or HATCHWAY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ecoutille</span></i>, a square or oblong opening in
the deck of a ship, of which there are several, forming the passages from
one deck to another, and into the <i>hold</i>, or lower apartments. See the <span class='sc'>Deck</span>,
plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. where A represents the main-hatchway of the lower deck; N N,
the fore-hatchway; and O O, the after-hatchway.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are likewise hatches of a smaller kind, called scuttles. See U U in
the same figure, as also the article <span class='sc'>Scuttle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Hatches</span> is also, although improperly, a name applied by sailors to the
covers or lids of the hatchways.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> HAUL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haler</span></i>, an expression peculiar to seamen, implying to pull a
single rope, without the assistance of blocks, or other mechanical powers:
when a rope is otherwise pulled, as by the application of tackles, or the
connection with blocks, &amp;c. the term is changed into <i>bowsing</i>. See also the
articles <span class='sc'>Bowse</span>, <span class='sc'>Hoist</span>, and <span class='sc'>Rowsing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Haul</span> <i>the wind</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">venir an vent</span></i>, to direct the ship’s course nearer to
that point of the compass from which the wind arises. Thus supposing a
ship sailing south-west, with the wind northerly, and some particular occasion
renders it necessary to haul the wind farther to the westward; to perform
this operation it is necessary to arrange the sails more obliquely with her
keel; to brace the yards more forward, by slackening the starboard, and pulling
in the larboard braces, and to haul the lower <i>sheets</i> farther aft: and
finally, to put the helm a-port, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> over to the larboard side of the vessel.
As soon as her head has turned directly to the westward, and her sails are
trimmed accordingly, she is laid to have hauled the wind four points, that
is to say, from S. W. to W. She may still go two points nearer to the
direction of the wind, by disposing her sails according to their greatest obliquity;
or, in the sea-phrase, by <i>trimming all sharp</i>: and in this situation
she is said to be close-hauled, as sailing W. N. W. See the articles <span class='sc'>Close-hauled</span>
and <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HAUSE, or HAWSE, is generally understood to imply the situation of the
cables before the ship’s stem, when she is moored with two anchors out from
forward, viz. one on the starboard, and the other on the larboard <i>bow</i>.
Hence it is usual to say, She has a clear hause, or a foul hause. It also
denotes any small distance <i>a-head</i> of a ship, or between her head and the
anchors employed to ride her; as, “He has anchored in our hause;” the
“brig fell athwart our hause,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship is said to ride with a clear hause, when the cables are directed to
their anchors, without lying athwart the stem; or crossing, or being twisted
round each other, by the ships winding about, according to the change of
the wind, tide, or current.</p>

<p class='c008'>A foul hause, on the contrary, implies that the cables lie across the stem,
or bear upon each other, so as to be rubbed and chafed by the motion of
the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hause accordingly is foul, by having either a cross, an elbow, or
a round turn. If the larboard cable, lying across the stem, points out on
the starboard side, while the starboard cable at the same time grows out
on the larboard side, there is a cross in the hause. If, after this, the ship,
without returning to her former position, continues to wind about the same
way, so as to perform an entire revolution, each of the cables will be twisted
round the other, and then directed out from the opposite bow, forming
what is called a round turn. An elbow is produced when the ship stops in
the middle of that revolution, after having had a cross: or, in other words,
if she rides with her head northward with a clear hause, and afterwards turns
quite round so as to direct her head northward again, she will have an elbow.
See the articles <span class='sc'>Elbow</span> and <span class='sc'>Riding</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Hause-holes</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ecubiers</span></i>, certain cylindrical holes cut through the bows of
a ship on each side of the item, through which the cables pass in order to
be drawn into, or let out of the vessel, as occasion requires. They are represented
by <i>d d</i> in fig. 10. plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. being fortified on each side by the</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Hause-pieces</span>, a name given to the foremost timbers of a ship, whose
lower ends rest upon the knuckle-timber, or the foremost of the cant-timbers.
They are generally parallel to the stem, having their upper ends sometimes
terminated by the lower part of the beak-head, and otherwise, by the
top of the bow, particularly in small ships and merchantmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>HEAD, an ornamental figure erected on the continuation of a ship’s stem,
as being expressive of her name, and emblematical of war, navigation, commerce,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The heads which have any affinity to war or navigation, are in general either
historical, as referring to some of the deities or heroes of antiquity; or allegorical,
as alluding to some of the natural consequences of battle, or the
virtues most essential to a life exposed to perpetual danger. Thus, in the
former sense, they represent a Neptune, an Alcides; a Mars, an Achilles;
a Minerva, or a Jason; and in the latter they produce a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Magnanime</span></i>, an
Intrepid, a Revenge, or a Victory.</p>

<p class='c008'>The head of a ship however has not always an immediate relation to her
name, at least in the British navy. Various instances might be produced to
shew, that our artists, as it suits their conveniency or judgment, can dispense
with this supposed idea of propriety. Hence we sometimes observe the
place of a Jason supplied by a Medea; or a best of prey made the representative
of an illustrious lady. The same liberty of design may therefore,
with equal propriety, be allowed to symbolize the successes of our arms,
by a groupe of heterogeneous figures, of sundry shapes and sizes, according
to the artists opinion of their superiority or subordination. Their attitude
and situation, as well as their size, must accordingly depend, in a great
measure, on the space into which they are to be crowded: for although
the figures may be of equal importance in themselves, yet as there is not
room for them all, as large as the life, on a ship’s head, it becomes expedient
to diminish a few, in order to give place to others. The emblems by which
allegorical figures are usually characterized in painting, poetry, and sculpture,
are not always thought necessary in a work of this kind, nor even
the postures in which these figures are exhibited. And indeed, if we reflect
with how much labour and application the workman has endeavoured to fill
up every vacancy with some little figure of a convenient form and size, we
ought rather to admire his ingenuity than censure him for a violation of
those general rules of art, by which it is supposed necessary, on such occasions,
to relieve the eye from a scene of perplexity and confusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The heads of many of our ships of war have undoubtedly great beauty
and propriety; and candour must acknowledge that some of the most elegant
and judicious have been borrowed from the French designs, which are never
left to the invention of illiterate mechanics. A multitude of ornaments
appears rather unnecessary in any building calculated for the purposes of
war. If there be any general rule to determine the subjects, and the quantity
of sculpture employed in ship-building, it seems to be connected with the
ideas of dignity and simplicity. These too are the genuine characteristics of
the Grecian and Roman orders of architecture, as opposed to that perplexity,
and rage for embellishment, which peculiarly distinguish the Gothic.
It is hardly possible for us to recollect the various disasters to which a single
hero, or goddess, on the head of a ship, is exposed by tempestuous weather,
battle, and the unexpected encounter of ships, without trembling for the
havoc and indecency that may happen in an assemblage of gods and conc-shells,
princesses and satyrs; heroes, blunder-buffes, sea-monsters, little children,
globes and thunder-bolts, and all the apparatus necessary to constitute the
head of a ship of the first class in our navy.</p>

<p class='c008'>In plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. we have sketched four heads, which are calculated for vessels
of different sizes and constructions. Fig. 6. exhibits an image of Hercules
brandishing his club over the heads of Cerberus, calculated for a ship of
the line. Fig. 7. represents Jupiter riding on his eagle, and armed with his
thunders, being a suitable head for a capital ship. The eagle displayed by
fig. 8. may serve for a frigate; and fig. 9. which expresses an incumbent
dragon, is very proper for any small vessel with a projecting beak or prow.
These figures have been selected from many others, because, being very rarely
used to decorate the head of a ship, it is possible that several of our readers
may never before have observed them. The two first, which are usually called
image-heads, are bold, warlike, and classical. The eagle in the third is
certainly a proper emblem of dignity, force, and velocity: and it is apprehended
neither the representation of the latter, nor any other figure in that
position, are to be met with amongst our shipping.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Head</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant</span></i>, is also used, in a more enlarged sense, to signify the whole
front or fore part of the ship, including the bows on each side: the head
therefore opens the column of water through which the ship passes when
advancing. Hence we say, head-sails, head-sea, head-way, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus fig. 10. plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. represents one side of the fore-part, or head of a
seventy-four gun ship, together with part of the bow, keel, and gunnel.
The names of the several pieces, exhibited therein, are as follow:</p>

<p class='c008'>A A fore part of the keel, with <i>a a</i> the two false keels beneath it.</p>

<p class='c008'>A C The stem.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>a a</i> The cat-head.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>b b</i> The supporter of the cat-head, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous-barbe</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>c c</i> The knight-head, or bollard-timber, of which there is one on each side,
to secure the inner-end of the bowsprit.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>d d</i> The hause-holes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>e e</i> The navel-hoods, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> thick pieces of plank laid upon the bow to
strengthen the edges of the hause-holes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>f</i> The davit-chock, by which the <i>davit</i> is firmly wedged while employed
to fish the anchor.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>g</i> The bulk-head, which terminates the forecastle on the fore-side, being
called the beak-head bulk-head by ship-wrights.</p>

<p class='c008'>H The gun-ports of the lower deck.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>h</i> The gun-ports of the upper deck and forecastle.</p>

<p class='c008'>I, I, The channels, with their dead-eyes and chain-plates.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>i</i> The gripe, or fore-foot, which unites the keel with the stem, forming
a part of either.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>k k</i> These dotted lines represent the thickness and descent of the different
decks from the fore-part of the ship towards the middle. The lowest of
the three dotted lines <i>l</i> expresses the convexity of the beams, the difference
between the height of the deck in the middle of its breadth, and at the
ship’s side. This is also exhibited more clearly in the midship-frame, where
the real curve of the beam is delineated.</p>

<p class='c008'>N. B. These lines must be always parallel to the lines which terminate
the gun-ports above and below.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>m m</i> The timbers of the head part of the bowsprit.</p>

<p class='c008'>X The rails of the head which lie across the timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Q Z Fore-part of the main-wale.</p>

<p class='c008'>R X Fore-part of the channel-wale.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is evident that the fore-part of a ship is called its head, from the affinity
of motion and position it bears to a fish, and in general to the horizontal
situation of all animals whilst swimming.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>By the</i> <span class='sc'>Head</span>, the state of a ship, which is laden deeper at the fore-end
than the after-end.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Head-fast</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amarre d’avant</span></i>, a rope employed to fasten a ship to a wharf,
chain, or buoy, or to some other vessel along-side.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Head-land</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">acrotere</span></i>, a name frequently given to a cape, or promontory.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Headmost</span>, the situation of any ship or ships which are the most advanced
in a fleet, or line of battle.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Head-rope</span>, that part of the bolt-rope which terminates any of the principal
sails on the upper-edge, which is accordingly sewed thereto. See the
article <span class='sc'>Bolt-rope</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Head-sails</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voiles de l’avant</span></i>, a general name for all those sails which are
extended on the fore-mast and bowsprit, and employed to command the fore-part
of the ship: such are the fore-sail, fore-top-sail, fore-top-gallant-sail, jib,
fore-stay-sail, and the sprit-sail with its top-sail. This term is used in opposition
to <i>after-sails</i>, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Head-to-wind</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de bout au vent</span></i>, the situation of a ship or boat, when her
head is turned to windward.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Head-way</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sillage</span></i>, the motion of advancing at sea. It is generally used
when a ship first begins to advance; or in calm weather, when it is doubtful
whether she is in a state of rest or motion. It is in both senses opposed to
retreating, or moving with the stern foremost. See the article <span class='sc'>Stern-way</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HEART, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moque</span></i>, a peculiar sort of dead-eye, somewhat resembling the
shape of a heart, but differing from the common dead-eyes, inasmuch as it
is only furnished with one large hole in the middle, fig. 32. plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. whereas
the common dead-eyes have always three holes. The hearts are principally
used to contain the <i>laniards</i>, by which the stays are extended. See <span class='sc'>Dead-Eye</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HEAVER, a name given by seamen to a wooden staff, employed by them
as a lever on many occasions; particularly in setting up the top-mast-shrouds,
frapping the top masts, dropping the larger blocks, seizing the standing
rigging, &amp;c. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>HEAVING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">virer</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heafian</span></i>, Sax.) the act of turning about a <i>capstern</i>,
<i>windlass</i>, or other machine of the like kind, by means of bars or handspecs.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heaving</span> <i>the lead</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Sounding</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heaving</span> <i>a-head</i>, is advancing the ship by heaving-in the cable, or other
rope, which is fastened to an anchor at some distance before her. To heave
a-stern is therefore to draw the ship backwards by the same operation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heaving</span>-<i>down</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Careening</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heaving</span>-<i>out</i>, the act of unfurling and throwing loose a sail from the
place where it had been rolled and fastened. This phrase is more particularly
applied to the stay-sails: thus we say, “Loose the top-sails, and heave
out the stay-sails!” which is accordingly done, either to <i>set</i> or <i>dry</i> them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heaving</span>-<i>short</i>, is the drawing so much of the cable into the ship, by
means of the capstern or windlass, as that by advancing, she will be almost
perpendicularly above the anchor, and in a proper situation to set sail.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heaving</span>-<i>taught</i>, the act of heaving about the capstern, till the rope
applied thereto becomes streight and ready for action.</p>

<p class='c008'>HEEL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">talon</span></i>, a name usually given to the after-end of a ship’s keel; as
also to the lower end of the stern-post, to which it is firmly connected.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heel</span> <i>of a mast</i>, the lower end, which is diminished into the frustrum of
a pyramid, so as to sink immoveably into a hole of the same shape, cut in the
step, which is attached to the ship’s keel.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Heel</span> <i>of a top-mast</i>, the lower end, which is sustained upon the <i>tressel-trees</i>
by means of an iron bar, called the fid. See the article <span class='sc'>Mast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Heel</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carguer</span></i>, to stoop or incline to either side. It is usually applied
to a ship when she is forced into this position by the wind acting upon her
sails, while braced obliquely across her; or by being ballasted so as to lean
more to one side than the other. See the articles <span class='sc'>Crank</span>, <span class='sc'>Stiff</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Trim</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HELM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernail</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">helme</span></i>, Sax.) a long and flat piece of timber, or an
assemblage of several pieces, suspended along the hind part of a ship’s stern-post,
where it turns upon hinges to the right or left, serving to direct the course
of the vessel, as the tail of a fish guides the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>The helm is usually composed of three parts, viz. the rudder, the tiller,
and the wheel, except in small vessels, where the wheel is unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The length and breadth of the rudder are represented in plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. where
it is evident that it becomes gradually broader in proportion to its distance
from the top, or to its depth under the water. The <i>back</i>, or inner part
of it, which joins to the stern-post, is diminished into the form of a wedge
throughout its whole length, so as that the rudder may be more easily turned
from one side to the other, where it makes an obtuse angle with the keel.
The hinges upon which it is supported are also expressed in this figure.
Those which are bolted round the stern-post to the after extremity of the
ship, are called googings, and are furnished with a large hole on the afterpart
of the stern-post. The other parts of the hinges, which are bolted to
the back of the rudder, are called pintles, being strong cylindrical pins,
which enter into the googings, and rest upon them. The length and thickness
of the rudder is nearly equal to that of the stern-post, as represented in
fig. 1. plate <a href='#X'>X</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rudder is turned upon its hinges by means of a long bar of timber,
called the tiller, which is fixed horizontally in its upper end within the
vessel. The movements of the tiller to the right and left, accordingly, direct
the efforts of the rudder to the government of the ship’s course as she advances,
which, in the sea-language, is called steering. The operations of
the tiller are guided and assisted by a sort of tackle, communicating with the
ship’s side, called the tiller-rope, which is usually composed of untarred
rope-yarns, for the purpose of traversing more readily through the blocks or
pullies.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to facilitate the management of the helm, the tiller-rope, in all
large vessels, is wound about a wheel, which acts upon it with the powers
of a crane or windlass. The rope employed in this service being conveyed
from the fore-end of the tiller <i>k</i>, to a single block <i>i</i>, on each side of the ship,
(plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. <span class='sc'>Deck</span>) is farther communicated to the wheel, by means of two
blocks, suspended near the mizen-mast, and two holes immediately above, leading
up to the wheel, which is fixed upon an axis, on the quarter-deck, almost
perpendicularly over the fore end of the tiller. Five turns of the tiller-rope are
usually wound about the barrel of the wheel, and, when the helm is amidship,
the middle turn is nailed to the top of the barrel, with a mark by which the
helmsman readily discovers the situation of the helm, as the wheel turns it
from the starboard to the larboard side. The spokes of the wheel generally
reach about eight inches beyond the rim or circumference, serving as handles
to the person who steers the vessel. As the effect of a lever increases in
proportion to the length of its arm, it is evident that the power of the helmsman,
to turn the wheel, will be increased according to the length of the
spokes, beyond the circumference of the barrel.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the helm, instead of lying in a right line with the keel, is turned
to one side or the other, as in BD, fig. 1. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. it receives an immediate
shock from the water, which glides along the ship’s bottom in running <i>aft</i>
from A to B; and this fluid pushes it towards the opposite side, whilst it is
retained in this position: so that the stern, to which the rudder is confined,
receives the same impression, and accordingly turns from B to <i>b</i> about some
point <i>c</i> whilst the head of the ship passes from A to <i>a</i>. It must be observed,
that the current of water falls upon the rudder obliquely, and only
strikes it with that part of its motion which acts according to the sine of
incidence, pushing it in the direction N P, with a force which not only
depends on the velocity of the ship’s course, by which this current of water
is produced, but also upon the extent of the sine of incidence. This force
is by consequence composed of the square of the velocity with which the
ship advances, and the square of the sine of incidence, which will necessarily
be greater or smaller according to circumstances; so that if the vessel runs
three or four times more swiftly, the absolute shock of the water upon the
rudder will be nine or sixteen times stronger under the same incidence: and,
if the incidence is increased, it will yet be augmented in a greater proportion,
because the square of the sine of incidence is more enlarged. This
impression, or, what is the same thing, the power of the helm, is always
very feeble, when compared with the weight of the vessel; but as it operates
with the force of a long lever, its efforts to turn the ship are extremely
advantageous. For the helm being applied to a great distance from the
centre of gravity, G, or from the point about which the vessel turns horizontally,
if the direction P N of the impression of the water upon the rudder
be prolonged, it is evident that it will pass perpendicularly to R, widely
distant from the centre of gravity G: thus the absolute effort of the water is
very powerful. It is not therefore surprizing that this machine impresses
the ship with a considerable circular movement, by pushing the stern from
B to <i>b</i>, and the head from A to <i>a</i>; and even much farther, whilst the sails
with rapidity: because the effect of the helm always keeps pace with the
velocity with which the vessel advances<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst the several angles that the rudder makes with the keel, there
is always one position more favourable than any of the others, as it
more readily produces the desired effect of turning the ship, in order to
change her course. To ascertain this, it must be considered, that if the obliquity
of the rudder with the keel is greater than the obtuse angle A B D,
so as to diminish that angle, the action of the water upon the rudder will
increase, and at the same time oppose the course of the ship in a greater degree;
because the angle of incidence will be more open, so as to present a greater
surface to the shock of the water, by opposing its passage more perpendicularly.
But at that time the direction N P of the effort of the helm upon
the ship will pass, with a smaller distance from the centre of gravity G
towards R, and less approach the perpendicular N L, according to which
it is absolutely necessary that the power applied should act with a greater
effect to turn the vessel. Thus it is evident that if the obtuse angle A B D is
too much enclosed, the greatest impulse of the water will not counterbalance
the loss sustained by the distance of the direction N P from N L; or
by the great obliquity, which is given to the same direction N P of the absolute
effort of the helm with the keel A B. If, on the contrary, the
angle A B D is too much opened, the direction N P of the force of action of
the helm will become more advantageous to turn the vessel, because it
will approach nearer the perpendicular N L; so that the line prolonged from
N P will increase the line G R, by removing R to a greater distance from
the centre of gravity G: but then the helm will receive the impression of the
water too obliquely, for the angle of incidence will be more acute; so that
it will only present a small portion of its breadth to the shock of the water,
and by consequence will only receive a feeble effort. By this principle it is
easy to conceive, that the greatest distance G R from the centre of gravity
G is not sufficient to repair the diminution of force occasioned by the too
great obliquity of the shock of the water. Hence we may conclude, that
when the water either strikes the helm too directly, or too obliquely, it loses
a great deal of the effect it ought to produce. Between the two extremes
there is therefore a mean position, which is the most favourable to its operations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diagonal N P of the rectangle I L represents the absolute direction
of the effort of the water upon the helm. N I expresses the portion of this
effort which is opposed to the ship’s head-way, or which pushes her astern,
in a direction parallel to the keel. It is easily perceived that this part N I of
the whole power of the helm contributes but little to turn the vessel; for if
I N is prolonged, it appears that its direction approaches to a very small
distance G V from the centre of gravity G, and that the arm of the lever
B N=G V, to which the force is applied, is not in the whole more than
equal to half the breadth of the rudder: but the relative force N L, which
acts perpendicular to the keel, is extremely different. If the first N I is
almost useless, and even pernicious, by retarding the velocity; the second
N L is capable of a very great effect, because it operates at a considerable
distance from the centre of gravity G of the ship, and acts upon the arm of
a lever G E, which is very long. Thus it appears, that between the effects
N L and N I, which result from the absolute effort N P, there is one which
always opposes the ship’s course, and contributes little to her motion of
turning; whilst the other produces only this movement of rotation, without
operating to retard her velocity<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Geometricians have determined the most advantageous angle made by the
helm with the line prolonged from the keel, and fixed it at 54° 44´ presuming
that the ship is as narrow at her floating-line, or at the line described
by the surface of the water round her bottom, as at the keel. But as this
supposition is absolutely false, inasmuch as all vessels augment their breadth
from the keel upward to the extreme breadth, where the floating-line or the
highest water-line is terminated; it follows that this angle is too large by a
certain number of degrees. For the rudder is impressed by the water, at
the height of the floating-line, more directly than at the keel, because the
fluid exactly follows the horizontal outlines of the bottom; so that a particular
position of the helm might be supposed necessary for each different
incidence which it encounters from the keel upwards. But as a middle
position may be taken between all these points, it will be sufficient to consider
the angle formed by the sides of the ship, and her <i>axis</i>, or the middle-line
of her length, at the surface of the water, in order to determine afterwards
the mean point, and the mean angle of incidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is evident that the angle 54° 44´ is too open, and very unfavourable
to the ship’s head-way, because the water acts upon the rudder there with
too great a sine of incidence, as being equal to that of the angle which it
makes with the line prolonged from the keel below: but above, the shock
of the water is almost perpendicular to the rudder, because of the breadth
of the bottom, as we have already remarked. If then the rudder is only
opposed to the fluid, by making an angle of 45° with the line prolonged
from the keel, the impression, by becoming weaker, will be less opposed to
the ship’s head-way, and the direction N P, fig. 1. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. of the absolute
effort of the water upon the helm drawing nearer to the lateral perpendicular,
will be placed more advantageously, for the reasons above
mentioned<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a>. On the other hand, experience daily testifies, that a ship
steers well when the rudder makes the angle D B E equal to 35° only.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been already remarked, that the effect of moving the wheel to
govern the helm increases in proportion to the length of the spokes; and so
great is the power of the wheel, that if the helmsman employs a force upon
its spokes equivalent to 30 pounds, it will produce an effect of 90 or 120
pounds upon the tiller. On the contrary, the action of the water is
collected into the middle of the breadth of the rudder, which is very narrow
in companion with the length of the tiller; so the effort of the water is
very little removed from the fulcrum B upon which it turns; whereas the
tiller forms the arm of a lever ten or fifteen times longer, which also increases
the power of the helmsman in the same proportion that the tiller bears to
the lever upon which the impulse of the water is directed. This force
then is by consequence ten or fifteen times stronger, and the effort of 30
pounds, which at first gave the helmsman a power equal to 90 or 120
pounds, becomes accumulated to one of 900 or 1800 pounds upon the rudder.
This advantage then arises from the shortness of the lever upon which
the action of the water is impressed, and the great comparative length of
the tiller, or lever, by which the rudder is governed; together with the
additional power of the wheel that directs the movements of the tiller, and
still farther accumulates the power of the helmsman over it. Such a demonstration
ought to remove the surprize with which the prodigious effect of
the helm is sometimes considered, from an inattention to its mechanism: for we
need only to observe the pressure of the water, which acts at a great distance
from the centre of gravity G, about which the ship is supposed to turn,
and we shall easily perceive the difference there is between the effort of the
water against the helmsman, and the effect of the same impulse against the
vessel. With regard to the person who steers, the water acts only with the
arm of a very short lever N B, of which B is the fulcrum: on the contrary,
with regard to the ship, the force of the water is impressed in the direction
N P, which passes to a great distance from G, and acts upon a very long
lever E G, which renders the action of the rudder extremely powerful in
turning the vessel; so that, in a large ship, the rudder receives a shock from
the water of 2700 or 2800 pounds, which is frequently the case, when she
sails at the rate of three or four leagues by the hour; and this force being
applied in E, perhaps 100 or 110 feet distant from the centre of gravity G,
will operate upon the ship, to turn her about, with 270000 or 308000
pounds; whilst, in the latter case, the helmsman acts with an effort which
exceeds not 30 pounds upon the spokes of the wheel.</p>

<p class='c008'>After what has been said of the helm, it is easy to judge, that the more
a ship increases her velocity with regard to the sea, the more powerful will
be the effect of the rudder, because it acts against the water with a force,
which increases as the square of the swiftness of the fluid, whether the ship
advances or retreats; or, in other words, whether she has head-way or stern-way;
with this distinction, that in these two circumstances the effects will
be contrary. For if the vessel retreats, or moves astern, the helm will be
impressed from I to N, fig. 1. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. and, instead of being pushed, according to
N P, it will receive the effort of the water from N towards R; so that the
stern wall be transported according to the same movement, and the head
turned in a contrary direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the helm operates by itself, the centre of rotation of the ship, and
her movement, are determined by estimating the force of this machine;
that is to say, by multiplying the surface of the rudder by the square of
the ship’s velocity<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a>. See the articles <span class='sc'>Rudder</span>, <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>, <span class='sc'>Steering</span>, <span class='sc'>Trim</span>,

<p class='c008'>HOASE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manche pour l’eau</span></i>, a long flexible tube, formed of leather or
tarred canvas, but chiefly of the latter, and employed to conduct the fresh
water, which is hoisted aboard a ship, into the casks that are ranged in
the hold; and to pass the water, or other liquors, out of one cask into another.
For the latter use, one of the ends or openings of the hoase is fixed in
the empty cask, whilst the other is applied to the pump that extracts the
water out of the full one. This exercise is, on some occasions, necessary to
alter or preserve the trim of the vessel, without disturbing her stowage.</p>

<p class='c008'>HOG, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goret</span></i>, a sort of flat scrubbing-broom, serving to scrape off the filth
from a ship’s bottom, under water, particularly in the act of <i>boot-topping</i>,
which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>This instrument is formed by inclosing a multitude of short twigs of birch,
or such wood, between two pieces of plank, which are firmly attached to
each other, after which the ends of the twigs or branches are cut off even,
so as to form a sort of brush of considerable strength. To this machine is fitted
a long staff, together with two ropes, the former of which is used to thrust
the hog under the ship’s bottom, and the latter to guide, and pull it up
again, close to the planks thereof, so as to rub off all the filth effectually.
This exercise is usually performed in the ship’s boat, which is accordingly
confined as close as possible to the vessel’s side during the operation, and
shifted from one part of the side to another, till the whole is compleated.</p>

<p class='c008'>HOIST, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guindant</span></i>, the perpendicular height of a flag or ensign, as opposed

<p class='c008'>HOISTING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hisser</span></i>, the operation of drawing up any body by the assistance

See the article <span class='sc'>Tackle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The act of pulling up any body, by the help of a single block only,
is never expressed by the term <i>hoisting</i>, if we except the exercise of extending
the sails, by drawing them upwards along the masts or stays, to
which it is invariably applied. See also <span class='sc'>Tracing-up</span> and <span class='sc'>Whipping</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HOLD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cale</span></i>, the whole interior cavity or belly of a ship, or all that part
of her inside, which is comprehended between the floor and the lower-deck,
throughout her whole length.</p>

<p class='c008'>This capacious apartment usually contains the ballast, provisions, and
stores of a ship of war, and the principal part of the cargo in a merchantman.
The disposition of those articles, with regard to each other, &amp;c. necessarily
falls under our consideration in the article <span class='sc'>Stowage</span>; it suffices in this place
to say, that the places where the ballast, water, provisions, and liquors are
stowed, are known by the general name of the hold. The several store-rooms
are separated from each other by <i>bulk-heads</i>, and are denominated
according to the articles which they contain, the sail-room, the bread-room,
the fish-room, the spirit-room, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fore</i>-<span class='sc'>Hold</span>, that part of the hold which is situated in the fore-part of the

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Hold</span>, in navigation, is generally understood to signify a particular
situation of a ship with regard to the shore, by which she is enabled to keep
within a sufficient distance, to facilitate her course, or answer some other
important object. Hence we say, Keep a good hold of the land! or, Keep
the shore well aboard! which are synonimous phrases, implying to keep near,
or in sight of the land.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Holding</span>-<i>on</i>, the act of pulling back the hind part of any cable, or other
rope, which is heaved round, by the capstern or windlass, or drawn in by
the purchase of a tackle. See <span class='sc'>Capstern</span> &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>To have a clearer idea of this exercise, it is necessary to premise, that
there are seldom or never more than three turns of any rope passed about the
barrel of the capstern, when it is employed in heaving; because a great
number of turns of a large rope would soon cover the whole barrel, and
utterly destroy the effect of this motion, till those turns could be removed;
a circumstance which might be attended with very bad consequences. On
the contrary, when there are only a few turns, the capstern or windlass is
always kept sufficiently clear for action for it is evident, that every revolution
of either will heave-in a quantity of the rope, upon which it is
employed, equal to the circumference of its barrel. Now as there are only
a few turns upon the barrel at once, an equal quantity of the rope will
necessarily come off from the capstern at the same time; and this is accordingly
pulled back as strongly as possible, to prevent it from <i>surging</i> or jerking
round the barrel, by being held too loosely. This is called <i>holding-on</i>,
which therefore may be defined, the act of retaining any quantity of rope,
acquired by the effort of a capstern, windlass, or tackle, as being employed
in hoisting as well as heaving.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Holding</span> <i>water</i>, the operation of stopping a boat in her course, by holding

<p class='c008'>HOLLOA! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commande!</span></i> an exclamation of answer, to any person, who
calls to another to ask some question, or to give a particular order. Thus,
if the master intends to give any order to the people in the main-top, he
previously calls, Main-top, hoay! To which they answer, Holloa! to shew
that they hear him, and are ready. It is also the first answer in hailing
a ship at a distance. See <span class='sc'>Hailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HOME, in a naval sense, either implies the situation of some object,
where it retains its full force of action; or where it is properly lodged for
convenience or security. In the former sense it is applied to the sails; and
in the latter, it usually refers to the stowage of the hold, or the anchors.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it is expressed of the sails, it denotes that their <i>clues</i>, or lower
corners, are close to the blocks upon the yard-arm, immediately beneath
them; it is therefore understood only of the loftier sails, as the top-sails,
top-gallant-sails, and the studding-sails thereto belonging. Hence to haul-home
the top-sail sheets, is to extend the bottom of the top-sail to the lower-yard,
by means of the sheets. See <span class='sc'>Clue</span> and <span class='sc'>Sheet</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the stowage of the hold, &amp;c. a cask, bale, or case, is said to be <i>home</i>,

interval between; and indeed the security, or firmness of the stowage, greatly
depends on this circumstance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Home</span>, when spoken of the anchor, seems to imply the station of the
ship, with regard to her anchor; which is accordingly said to come home
when it loosens from the ground, by the effort of the cable, and approaches
the place where the ship floated, at the length of her moorings. See the

three feet under the yard for the sailors to tread upon, whilst they are
loosing, reefing or furling the sails, rigging out the studding-sail booms, &amp;c.
In order therefore to keep the horse more parallel to the yard, it is usually
suspended thereto, at proper distances, by certain ropes called <i>stirrups</i>,
which hang about two feet under the yard, having an eye in their lower
ends through which the horse passes. See the article <span class='sc'>Rigging</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Horse</span> is also a thick rope, extended in a perpendicular direction near the
<i>fore</i> or <i>after</i>-side of a mast, for the purpose of hoisting or extending some sail
thereon. When it is fixed before a mast, it is calculated for the use of a
sail called the <i>square-sail</i>, whose yard being attached to the horse, by means
of a <i>traveller</i>, or <i>bull’s-eye</i>, which slides up and down occasionally, is retained
in a steddy position, either when the sail is set, or whilst it is hoisting
or lowering. When the horse is placed <i>abaft</i> or behind a mast, it is intended
for the <i>try-sail</i> of a snow, and is accordingly very rarely fixed in
this position, except in those sloops of war which occasionally assume the

<p class='c008'>HOUNDS, a name given to those parts of a mast-head, which gradually
project on the right and left side, beyond the cylindrical or conical surface,

<p class='c008'>HOY, a small vessel, chiefly used in coasting, or carrying goods to or

with safety or convenience.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be very difficult to describe, precisely, the marks of distinction
between this vessel and some others of the same size, which are also rigged

these vessels, have, upon examination, very vague ideas of the marks by
which they are distinguished from those above mentioned. In Holland, the
hoy has two masts; in England it has but one, where the main-sail is
sometimes extended by a boom, and sometimes without it. Upon the whole,
it may be defined a small vessel, usually rigged as a sloop, and employed

<p class='c008'>The mast of this vessel, <i>a a</i>, fig. 2. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. is extremely high, and withal
properly strengthened by <i>shrouds</i> and <i>stays</i>, in order to secure the sheers,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">machine à mater</span></i>, which serve, as the arm of a crane, to hoist out or in the
masts of any ship lying alongside. The sheers, <i>b b</i>, are composed of several
long masts, whose heels rest upon the side of the hulk, and having
their heads declining outward from the perpendicular, so as to hang over
the vessel whose masts are to be fixed or displaced. The tackles, <i>c c</i>,
which extend from the head of the mast to the sheer-heads, are intended to
pull in the latter towards the mast-head, particularly when they are charged
with the weight of a mast after it is raised out of any ship, which is performed
by strong tackles depending from the sheer-heads. The effort of
these tackles is produced by two capsterns, fixed on the deck for this
purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Hulk</span> is also a name bestowed on any old vessel laid by, as unfit for
further service: it is probably derived from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ολκαδες</span>, or vessels of burthen
of the ancient Grecians.</p>

<p class='c008'>HULL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d’un vaisseau</span></i>, the frame, or body of a ship, exclusive of
her masts, yards, sails, and rigging: it is usually expressed of a ship either
before she is furnished with masts, &amp;c. or after she is dismasted and stripped
of the aforesaid machinery.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span> <i>a ship</i>, is to fire cannon-balls into her hull within the point-blank
range.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Hull</span>-<i>to</i>, the situation of a ship when she is <i>trying a-hull</i>, or with all
her sails furled; as in trying. See the article <span class='sc'>Trying</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>HURRICANE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ouragan</span></i>, (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">huracan</span></i>, Span.) a violent and prodigious tempest,
occasioned by the collection and opposition of several winds, that sometimes
blow from one quarter and sometimes from another, producing a dangerous
agitation in the sea, where the waves break, and dash against each other
with astonishing fury. On the approach of a hurricane, the sea and air become
perfectly calm and motionless, without a breath of wind stirring either. Soon
after this the sky is darkened, the clouds accumulate, and the light of the
day is replaced by terrible flashes of lightening. The hurricanes often last
abundantly long, and are usually accompanied with many fatal accidents<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a>.
During the continuance of this general calamity, the vessels which were anchored
in the roads frequently cut their cables and put to sea, where they
drive at the mercy of the winds and waves, after having struck their yards
and top-masts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hurricanes are more usual between the tropics, particularly in the
Atlantic ocean, than to the northward or southward of the torrid zone.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>J.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>JACK, a sort of flag or colours, displayed from a mast erected on the
outer end of a ship’s bowsprit. In the British navy the jack is nothing
more than a small union flag, composed of the intersection of the red and
white crosses; but in merchant ships this union is bordered with a red field.
See the article <span class='sc'>Union</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>JAMMING, the act of inclosing any object between two bodies, so as
to render it immoveable, whilst they continue in the same position. This
expression is usually applied to the situation of some running-rope, when it
happens to be squeezed by the compression of the standing-rigging, &amp;c.
and by consequence incapable of performing its office, by traversing in the
blocks, till it is released from this confinement. In this sense jamming is
opposed to <i>rendering</i>, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>A cask, box, &amp;c. is also said to be jammed, when it is in the same manner
wedged in between weighty bodies, so as not to be dislodged without great
difficulty.</p>

<p class='c008'>JEARS, or GEERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">drisse</span></i>, an assemblage of tackles, by which the lower
yards of a ship are hoisted up along the mast to their usual station, or lowered
from thence as occasion requires; the former of which operations is called
<i>swaying</i>, and the latter, <i>striking</i>. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a ship of war, the jears are usually composed of two strong tackles,
each of which has two blocks, viz. one fastened to the lower-mast-head, and
the other to the middle of the yard. The two blocks which are <i>lashed</i> to
the middle, or <i>slings</i> of the yard, are retained in this situation by means of
two cleats, nailed on each side, whose arms enclose the ropes by which the
blocks are fastened to the yard. The two ropes, which communicate with
these tackles, lead down to the deck on the opposite side of the mast, according
to the situation of the upper jear-blocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The jears, in merchant-ships, have usually two large single blocks on the
opposite side of the mast-head, and another of the same size in the middle
of the yard. The rope, which communicates with these, passes through
one of the blocks hanging at the mast-head, then through the block on the
yard, and afterwards through the other hanging-block upon the mast. To
the two lower ends of this rope, on the opposite sides of the mast, are fixed
two tackles, each of which is formed of two double blocks, the lower one
being hooked to a ring-bolt in the deck, and the upper one spliced, or seized
into the lower end of the great rope above, which is called the tye. By
this contrivance the mechanical power of the tackle below is transmitted to
the tye, which, communicating with blocks on the yard, readily <i>sways up</i>,
or lowers it, either by the effort of both jears at once, on the opposite sides
of the mast, or by each of them separately, one after the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>JETTY-HEAD, a name usually given, in the royal dock-yards, to that
part of a wharf which projects beyond the rest; but more particularly the
front of a wharf, whose side forms one of the cheeks of a dry or wet dock.</p>

<p class='c008'>JEWEL-BLOCKS, a name given to two small blocks, which are suspended
at the extremity of the main and fore-top-sail-yards, by means of
an eye-bolt, driven from without into the middle of the yard-arm, parallel
to its axis. The use of these blocks is to retain the upper-part of the topmast
studding-sails beyond the skirts of the top-sails, so that each of those
sails may have its full force of action, which would be diminished by the
incroachment of the other over its surface. The <i>haliards</i>, by which those
studding-sails are hoisted, are accordingly passed through the jewel-blocks;
whence, communicating with a block on the top-mast-head, they lead downwards
to the top or decks, where they may be conveniently hoisted. See the
article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>JIB, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foc</span></i>, the foremost sail of a ship, being a large stay-sail extended from
the outer end of the bowsprit, prolonged by the jib-boom, towards the
fore-top-mast-head. See <i>Sail</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The jib is a sail of great command with any side-wind, but especially
when the ship is <i>close-hauled</i>, or has the wind upon her beam; and its effort
in <i>casting</i> the ship, or turning her head to leeward, is very powerful, and of great
utility, particularly when the ship is <i>working</i> through a narrow channel. See
<span class='sc'>Sailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jib-Boom</span>, a boom run out from the extremity of the bowsprit, parallel
to its length, and serving to extend the bottom of the jib, and the stay of the
fore-top-gallant-mast. This boom, which is nothing more than a continuation
of the bowsprit forward, to which it may be considered as a top-mast,
is usually attached to the bowsprit by means of two large boom-irons, (see
the article <span class='sc'>Iron-Work</span>) or by one boom-iron, and a <i>cap</i> on the outer-end
of the bowsprit; or, finally, by the cap without, and a strong lashing within,
instead of a boom-iron; which is generally the method of securing it in small
merchant-ships. It may therefore be drawn in upon the bowsprit, as occasion
requires, which is usually practised when the ship enters a harbour,
where it might very soon be broke, or carried away, by the vessels which are
moored therein, or passing by under sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>JIBING. See <span class='sc'>Gybing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>JIGGER, a machine, consisting of a piece of rope about five feet long,
with a block at one end and a sheave at the other; and used to <i>hold-on</i> the
cable, when it is heaved into the ship by the revolution of the <i>windlass</i>. See
<span class='sc'>Holding-on</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The jigger is particularly useful when the cable is either slippery with
mud or ooze, or when it is stiff and unwieldy; in both of which cases it is
very difficult to stretch it back from the windlass by hand, which however is
done with facility and expedition, by means of the jigger, as follows: the
end of the rope, to which the sheave is fastened by a knot, is passed round
the cable close to the windlass, and the hind part of the rope coming over
the sheave, is stretched aft by means of another rope passing through the jigger-block.
As soon as the last rope is extended, the turn of the former about
the cable is firmly retained in its position, by the compression of its hind
part under the sheave, acting upon what may be called the neck of the jigger.
But as the cable continues to be heaved into the ship, it is evident
that the jigger, which is fastened on a particular part thereof, stretching
it back, will be removed further aft, by every turn of the windlass, and the
effort of the jigger will be lessened in proportion to its distance from the
windlass: this circumstance renders it necessary to <i>fleet</i> it, or replace in
a proper state of action, as occasion requires. The man who performs this
office accordingly calls out, fleet, jigger! one of the men, at the windlass,
instantly fixes his handspec between the deck and the cable, so as to <i>jam</i> the
latter to the windlass, and prevent it from running out till the jigger is refixed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jigger-Tackle</span>, a light small tackle, consisting of a double and single
block, and used on sundry occasions by seamen. See <span class='sc'>Tackle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>IN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dedans</span></i>, the state of any of a ship’s sails, when they are furled or
stowed. It is used in this sense also in opposition to <i>out</i>, which implies that
they are <i>set</i>, or extended to assist the ship’s course.</p>

<p class='c008'>INSURANCE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">assurance</span></i>, a certain contract, by which an individual, or
company, agrees to indemnify whatever losses or damages may happen to a
ship or cargo, during a voyage, provided they are not occasioned by default
of the person insured. For this agreement the latter pays a certain sum in
advance, called the <i>præmium</i>, which accordingly falls to the insurer, in case
the ship arrives in a safe harbour; but if the ship is lost, the insurer renders
the stipulated sum to the merchant.</p>

<p class='c008'>JOURNAL, in navigation, a sort of diary, or daily register of the ship’s
course, winds, and weather; together with a general account of whatever is
material to be remarked in the period of a sea-voyage.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all sea-journals, the day, or what is called the 24 hours, terminates
at noon, because the errors of the dead-reckoning are at that period generally
corrected by a solar observation. The daily compact usually contains
the state of the weather; the variation, increase, or diminution of the wind;
and the suitable shifting, reducing, or enlarging the quantity of sail extended;
as also the most material incidents of the voyage, and the condition
of the ship and her crew; together with the discovery of other ships or
fleets, land, shoals, breakers, soundings, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The form of keeping journals is very different in merchant-ships; but
one method appears to be invariably pursued in the navy, which nevertheless
is certainly capable of improvement, because no form can be properly
called perfect, that leaves as great a space for one day’s work, the matter of
which may be contained in very few lines, as for another that abounds with
important incidents, so as to occupy ten times the space. If therefore there be
any such thing as propriety of method on this occasion, it seems to imply,
that the space containing, should conform to the matter contained, which
will necessarily be greater or less, according to circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>IRON-WORK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ferrure</span></i>, a general name for all the pieces of iron, of
whatsoever figure or size, which are used in the construction of a ship: as
bolts, boom-irons, nails, spikes, chains and chain-plates, block-strops, cranks,
braces, pintles, and googings.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most material of these articles are explained in their proper places;
but as the article <i>bolt</i>, of which the figures are represented in plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. was
accidentally omitted in the proper place, according to the plan of this work,
it may not be improperly introduced here.</p>

<p class='c008'>A bolt then is generally a cylindrical pin of iron, of which there are various
sorts, used for sundry occasions in ship-building.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bolts are principally employed either to unite several members of a
ship’s frame into one solid piece, or to fasten any moveable body on a particular
occasion. Those which are calculated for the former purpose have
commonly small round heads, somewhat flatted, as in fig. 1 &amp; 2. plate <a href='#II'>II</a>.
On the contrary, the bolts which are intended for the latter use, have
either a large round head, as those of the chains, fig. 4. or an eye, with or
without a ring in the same place, fig. 5, 6, and 39, as those which are designed
to secure the great guns, the <i>jears</i> of the main-sail and fore-sail, the
stoppers of the cables, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bolts are short or long, according to the thickness of the timber
wherein they are to be lodged: they penetrate either quite through the pieces
into which they are driven, or to a certain determinate depth. The last
of these, called a rag-bolt, is retained in its situation by means of several
barbs, fig. 3. which, fastening into the timbers, prevent the bolt from loosening
from its station by the working of the ship. The first, after being driven
through the pieces it is intended to unite, is confined by a flat iron wedge,
called the forelock, which is thrust through a narrow hole in the small end
of the bolt, where it is hardened home by a hammer; and to prevent the
forelock from cutting the wood-work in this position, a little iron ring is
fixed over the end of the bolt, between the forelock and the timber.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those bolts, which have the largest of the round-heads, are called fender-bolts,
being driven into the wales, stem, or sides of some small vessels of
burthen, as lighters, beancods, prames, &amp;c. to defend their timber-work
from the shock of any other vessels which may fall aboard by accident.</p>

<p class='c008'>A boom-iron is composed of two iron rings, formed into one piece, so as
nearly to resemble the figure of 8. It is employed to connect two cylindrical
pieces of wood together, when the one is used as a continuation of the other;
such is the jib-boom to the bowsprit; and such are the <i>studding-sail</i> booms
to the respective yards from whose extremities they are prolonged. The
rims, or circles of the boom-irons, are broad and flat; and one of them, which
is firmly driven upon the main, or fore-yard-arm, is somewhat larger than
the other, as exhibited in fig. 7. plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. The studding-sail-boom usually
rests in the small ring, through which it is occasionally thrust outwards from
the yard-arm, when the studding-sail is to be set. Every boom of this kind
has, or ought to have, two boom-irons, one of which is fixed on the extremity
of the yard, and the other further inward. The former of these is
frequently framed of one ring only, which projects from the end of the yard,
where it is fastened by a strong iron bar, opening into a sort of fork or crotch
that slides upon the yard lengthwise, where it is fastened by nails driven from
above and below.</p>

<p class='c008'>ISLAND of ICE, a name given by sailors to a great quantity of ice collected
into one huge solid mass, and floating about upon the seas near or
within the arctic circle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of these fluctuating islands are met with on the coasts of Spitzbergen,
to the great danger of the shipping employed in the Greenland fishery.</p>

<p class='c008'>JUNK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouts de cable</span></i>, a name given to any remnants or pieces of old cable,
which is usually cut into small portions for the purpose of making points,
mats, gaskets, sennit, &amp;c. See <span class='sc'>Points</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>JURY-MAST, a temporary or occasional mast, erected in a ship to supply
the place of one which has been carried away by tempest, battle, or the
labouring of a ship in a turbulent sea.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>K.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>KAICLING, or KECKLING, a name given to any old ropes, which
are wound about a cable, with a small interval between the turns, and
used to preserve the surface of the cable from being fretted, when it rubs
against the ship’s bow, or <i>fore-foot</i>. See also <span class='sc'>Rounding</span> and <span class='sc'>Service</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>KEDGE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancre de touei</span></i>, a small anchor, used to keep a ship steddy whilst
she rides in a harbour or river, particularly at the turn of the tide, when
she might otherwise drive over her principal anchor, and entangle the stock
or flukes with her slack cable, so as to loosen it from the ground. This is
accordingly prevented by a kedge-rope, that restrains her from approaching it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The kedges are also particularly useful in <i>transporting</i> a ship, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> removing
her from one part of the harbour to another, by means of ropes,
which are fastened to these anchors. They are generally furnished with an
iron stock, which is easily displaced, for the convenience of stowing them.
See the articles <span class='sc'>Anchor</span> and <span class='sc'>Warp</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>KEEL, the principal piece of timber in a ship, which is usually first laid
on the blocks in building.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we compare the carcase of a ship to the skeleton of the human body,
the keel may be considered as the back-bone, and the timbers as the ribs.
It therefore supports and unites the whole fabric, since the stem and stern-post,
which are elevated on its ends, are, in some measure, a continuation
of the keel, and serve to connect and enclose the extremities of the sides by
transoms; as the keel forms and unites the bottom by timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The keel is generally composed of several thick pieces, (A, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.
<span class='sc'>Pieces</span> of the <span class='sc'>Hull</span>) placed lengthways, which, after being scarfed together,
are bolted, and clinched upon the upper side. When these pieces cannot
be procured large enough to afford a sufficient depth to the keel, there
is a strong thick piece of timber bolted to the bottom thereof, called the
<i>false keel</i>, which is also very useful in preserving the lower-side of the main
keel. In our largest ships of war, the false keel is generally composed of
two pieces, which are called the upper and the lower false keels. See <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lowest plank in a ship’s bottom, called the <i>garboard-streak</i>, has its
inner-edge let into a groove, or channel, cut longitudinally on the side of the
keel: the depth of this channel is therefore regulated by the thickness of
the garboard-streak.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Keel</span> is also a name given to a low flat-bottomed vessel, used in the river
Tyne to bring the coals down from Newcastle, and the adjacent parts, in
order to load the colliers for transportation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Upon an even</i> <span class='sc'>Keel</span>, the position of a ship when her keel is parallel to the
plane of the horizon, so that she is equally deep in the water at both ends.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Keel-hauling</span>, a punishment inflicted for various offences in the Dutch
navy. It is performed by plunging the delinquent repeatedly under the
ship’s bottom on one side, and hoisting him up on the other, after having
passed under the keel. The blocks, or pullies, by which he is suspended,
are fastened to the opposite extremities of the main-yard, and a weight of
lead or iron is hung upon his legs to sink him to a competent depth. By
this apparatus he is drawn close up to the yard-arm, and thence let fall
suddenly into the sea, where, passing under the ship’s bottom, he is
hoisted up on the opposite side of the vessel. As this extraordinary sentence
is executed with a serenity of temper peculiar to the Dutch, the culprit is
allowed sufficient intervals to recover the sense of pain, of which indeed he
is frequently deprived during the operation. In truth, a temporary insensibility
to his sufferings ought by no means to be construed into a disrespect
of his judges, when we consider that this punishment is supposed to have
peculiar propriety in the depth of winter, whilst the flakes of ice are floating
on the stream; and that it is continued till the culprit is almost suffocated
for want of air, benumbed with the cold of the water, or stunned with the
blows his head receives by striking the ship’s bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> KEEP, a term used on several occasions in navigation: as,</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Keep</span> <i>the land aboard</i>, is to keep within sight of land as much as possible.
See also <span class='sc'>Hold</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Keep</span> <i>the luff</i>, to continue close to the wind, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> sailing with a course
inclined to the direction of the wind, as much as possible, without deviating
to leeward. This is also called, <i>keeping the wind</i>. See <span class='sc'>Close-hauled</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Keep</span> <i>off</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">alargeer</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tenir le largue</span></i>, to sail off, or keep at a distance from
the shore. See also <span class='sc'>Offing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Boat</i>-<span class='sc'>Keeper</span>, one of the rowers, who remains as a centinel in his turn, to
take care of any boat and her contents, either when she lies by the shore, or
along-side of the ship; or when she is towed astern of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>KELSON, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre quille</span></i>, a piece of timber, which may be properly defined
the interior, or counter-part of the keel, as it is laid upon the middle of
the floor-timbers, immediately over the keel, and, like it, composed of several
pieces, scarfed together, represented by X, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> of the
<span class='sc'>Hull</span>. In order to fit with more security upon the floor-timbers and
crotches, it is notched about an inch and a half deep, opposite to each of
those pieces, and thereby firmly scored down upon them to that depth, where
it is secured by spike-nails. The pieces of which it is formed are only half
the breadth and thickness of those of the keel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The kelson serves to bind and unite the floor-timbers to the keel. It is
confined to the keel by long bolts, which, being driven from without through
several of the timbers, are fore-locked or clinched upon rings on the upper
side of the kelson.</p>

<p class='c008'>KETCH, a vessel equipped with two masts, viz. the main-mast and
mizen-mast, and usually from 100 to 250 tons burthen.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ketches</span> are principally used as yachts, or as bomb-vessels, the former of
which are employed to convey princes of the blood, ambassadors, or other
great personages from one part to another; and the latter are used to bombard
citadels, or towns, or other fortresses.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bomb-ketches are therefore furnished with all the apparatus necessary
for a vigorous bombardment. They are built remarkably strong, as being-fitted
with a greater number of <i>riders</i> than any other vessel of war; and indeed
this reinforcement is absolutely necessary to sustain the violent shock
produced by the discharge of their mortars, which would otherwise, in a
very short time, shatter them to pieces. See <span class='sc'>Mortar</span> and <span class='sc'>Shell</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>KEVELS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">taquets</span></i>, a frame composed of two pieces of timber, whose
lower ends rest in a sort of step or foot, nailed to the ship’s side, from whence
the upper ends branch outward into arms or horns, serving to belay the
great ropes by which the bottoms of the main-sail and fore-sail are extended.
These are represented by fig. 3. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>KEY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quai</span></i>, a long wharf, usually built of stone, by the side of a harbour
or river, and having several store-houses for the convenience of lading and
discharging merchant-ships. It is accordingly furnished with posts and rings,
whereby they are secured; together with cranes, capsterns, and other engines,
to lift the goods into, or out of, the vessels which lie along-side.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Keys</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attalons</span></i>, are also certain sunken rocks, lying near the surface of the
water, particularly in the West-Indies.</p>

<p class='c008'>KINK, a sort of twist or turn in any cable or other rope, occasioned
by its being very stiff or close-laid; or by being drawn too hastily out of
the roll or tier, when it lies coiled. See the article <span class='sc'>Coiling</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>KNEE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courbe</span></i>, a crooked piece of timber, having two branches, or arms,
and generally used to connect the beams of a ship with her sides or timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The branches of the knees form an angle of greater or smaller extent,
according to the mutual situation of the pieces which they are designed to
unite. One branch is securely bolted to one of the deck-beams, whilst the
other is in the same manner attached to a corresponding timber in the ship’s
side, as represented by E in the <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the great utility of knees in connecting the beams and timbers into
one compact frame, they contribute greatly to the strength and solidity of
the ship, in the different parts of her frame to which they are bolted, and thereby
enable, her, with greater firmness, to resist the effects of a turbulent
sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fixing of these pieces, it is occasionally necessary to give an oblique
direction to the vertical, or side-branch, in order to avoid the range of an
adjacent gun-port, or, because the knee may be so shaped as to require this
disposition; it being sometimes difficult to procure so great a variety of
knees as may be necessary in the construction of a number of ships of war.</p>

<p class='c008'>In France, the scarcity of these pieces has obliged their shipwrights frequently
to form their knees of iron.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Knees</span> are either said to be <i>lodging</i> or <i>hanging</i>. The former are fixed
horizontally in the ship’s frame, having one arm bolted to the beam, and
the other across two or three timbers, as represented by F in the <span class='sc'>Deck</span>,
plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. The latter are fixed vertically, as we have described above. See
also <span class='sc'>Building</span>, <span class='sc'>Deck</span>, and <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Knee</span> <i>of the head</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poulaine</span></i>, a large flat piece of timber, fixed edgways upon
the fore-part of a ship’s stem, and supporting the ornamental figure or image,
placed under the bowsprit. See the article <span class='sc'>Head</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The knee of the head, which may properly be defined a continuation of
the stem, as being prolonged from the stem forwards, is extremely broad at
the upper-part, and accordingly composed of several pieces united into one,
Y Y, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> of the <span class='sc'>Hull</span>. It is let into the head, and secured to the
ship’s <i>bows</i> by strong knees fixed horizontally upon both, and called the
<i>cheeks of the head</i>, Z Z, plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. fig. 10. The heel of it is scarfed to the
upper end of the fore-foot, and it is fastened to the stem above by a knee,
called a <i>standard</i>, expressed by &amp;, in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> of the <span class='sc'>Hull</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides supporting the figure of the head, this piece is otherwise useful, as
serving to secure the boom, or <i>bumkin</i>, by which the fore-tack is extended
to windward; and, by its great breadth, preventing the ship from
falling to leeward, when <i>close-hauled</i>, so much as she would otherwise do. It
also affords a greater security to the bowsprit, by increasing the angle of
the bob-stay, so as to make it act more perpendicularly on the bowsprit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The knee of the head is a phrase peculiar to shipwrights; as this piece is
always called the <i>cut-water</i> by seamen, if we except a few, who affecting to be
wiser than their brethren, have adopted this expression probably on the presumption
that the other is a cant phrase, or vulgarism. It appears a material
part of the province of this work to call the several articles contained therein
by their proper names, and to reject those which are spurious, however
sanctified by the authority of official dulness, or seconded by the adoption of
dignified ignorance. Accordingly we cannot help observing, that when a
term of art has been established from time immemorial, and besides being
highly expressive, produces the testimony of foreign nations<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> to its propriety,
nothing more certainly betrays a superficial understanding, than the attempt
to change it, without being able to assign the shadow of a reason for this
alteration. For although <i>knee of the head</i>, being invariably used by the
artificers, is of course explained in this work as a term of naval architecture,
wherein practice has indeed rendered it natural and intelligible; it is nevertheless
very rarely used by seamen, especially in common discourse, unless
when it is intended to impress the hearer with an idea of the speaker’s superior
judgment.</p>

<p class='c008'>KNIGHT-HEAD, or <span class='sc'>Bollard-Timber</span>. See the article <span class='sc'>Head</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Knight-Heads</span>, two strong pieces of timber, fixed on the opposite
sides of the main-deck, a little behind the fore-mast, in a merchant-ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are used to support and inclose the ends of the windlass, which accordingly
is turned therein as upon an axis. As each of the knight-heads is
formed of two pieces, they may be occasionally separated in order to take
off the turns of the cable from the windlass, or replace them upon it. They
are sometimes called the <i>bits</i>, and in this sense their upper-parts only are
denominated knight-heads, which being formerly embellished with a figure
designed to resemble a human head, gave rise to the name they have ever since
retained. See the article <span class='sc'>Windlass</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Knight-heads</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sep de drisse</span></i>, was also a name formerly given to the lower
jear-blocks, which were then no other than bits, containing several sheaves,
and nearly resembling our present top-sail-sheet bits.</p>

<p class='c008'>KNITTLE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eguillette</span></i>, (<i>from knit</i>) a small line, which is either plaited or
twisted, and used for various purposes at sea; as to fasten the service on
the cable, to reef the sails by the bottom, and to hang the hammocs between
decks, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>KNOT, a large knob formed on the extremity of a rope, by untwisting the
ends thereof, and interweaving them regularly amongst each other. There are
several sorts of knots, which differ in their form and size, according to the
uses for which they are designed: the principal of these are the diamond-knot,
the rose-knot, the wall-knot or walnut, some of which are single, and
others double.</p>

<p class='c008'>The knots are generally used to fasten one rope to another, by means of
a small cord attached to the neck of the knot, called the <i>laniard</i>, which is
firmly tied about both ropes. They are also designed to prevent the end
of a rope from sliding through an <i>eye</i>, which the knot is intended to confine
in a particular situation. See <span class='sc'>Beckets</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>L.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'><i>TO</i> LABOUR, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">travailler</span></i>, as a sea-term, implies to roll or pitch heavily
in a turbulent sea; an effect, by which the masts and hull of the ship
are greatly endangered, because by the rolling motion the masts strain
upon their shrouds with an effort, which increases as the sine of their obliquity:
and the continual agitation of the vessel gradually loosens her joints,
and often makes her extremely leaky.</p>

<p class='c008'>LADDER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">echelle</span></i>, a well-known convenience, of which there are a great
number in a ship, formed of two pieces of plank joined together by crosspieces,
which serve as steps, whereby to mount or descend from one deck to
another.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ladders derive their names from the several hatchways, or other parts
of a ship, wherein they are situated. Besides these, there are, of a particular
construction, the accommodation-ladder and the quarter-ladders.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accommodation</i>-<span class='sc'>Ladder</span>, is a sort of light stair-case, occasionally fixed on
the gangway of the admiral, or commander in chief, of a fleet. It is furnished
with rails and entering-ropes, covered with red bays, and the lower-end of
it is retained at a competent distance from the ship’s side by iron bars, or
braces, to render the passage more convenient to those who enter or depart
from the ship. See the article <span class='sc'>Gangway</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Quarter</i>-<span class='sc'>Ladders</span>, two ladders of rope, depending from the right and left
side of a ship’s stern, whereby to descend into the boats which are moored
astern, in order to bring them up along-side of the ship; or to use them for
any other occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>LADEN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargée</span></i>, the state of a ship when she is charged with a weight
or quantity of any sort of merchandizes, or other materials, equal to her
tonnage or burthen. If the cargo with which she is laden is extremely heavy,
her burthen is determined by the weight of the goods; and if it is light,
she carries as much as she can <i>stow</i>, to be fit for the purposes of navigation.
As a ton in measure is generally estimated at 2000 lb. in weight, a vessel
of 200 tons ought accordingly to carry a weight equal to 400,000 lb. when
the matter of which the cargo is composed is specifically heavier than the
water in which she floats; or, in other words, when the cargo is so heavy
that she cannot float high enough, with so great a quantity of it, as her hold
will contain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Laden</span> <i>in bulk</i>, the state of being freighted with a cargo which is neither
in casks, boxes, bales, or cases, but lies loose in the hold; being defended
from the moisture, or wet of the hold, by a number of mats and a quantity
of <i>dunnage</i>. Such are usually the cargoes of corn, salt, or such materials.</p>

<p class='c008'>LAID-UP, the situation of a ship when she is either moored in a harbour
during the winter season, or laid by, for want of employment: or when by
age and craziness she is rendered incapable of further service.</p>

<p class='c008'>LANCH, a peculiar sort of long-boat, used by the French, Spanish, and
Italian shipping; and in general by those of other European nations, when
employed in voyaging in the Mediterranean sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>A lanch is proportionably longer, lower, and more flat-bottomed than the
long-boat; it is by consequence less fit for sailing, but better calculated for
rowing and approaching a flat shore. Its principal superiority to the long-boat,
however, consists in being, by its construction, much fitter to under-run
the cable, which is a very necessary employment in the harbours of the
Levant sea, where the cables of different ships are fastened across each other,
and frequently render this exercise extremely necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lanch</span> is also the movement by which a ship or boat descends from the
shore, either when she is at first built, or at any time afterwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>To facilitate the operation of lanching, and prevent any interruption
therein, the ship is supported by two strong platforms, laid with a gradual
inclination to the water, on the opposite sides of her keel, to which they are
parallel. Upon the surface of this declivity are placed two corresponding
ranges of planks, which compose the base of a frame called the <i>cradle</i>, whose
upper-part envelops the ship’s bottom, whereto it is securely attached. Thus
the lower surface of the cradle, conforming exactly to that of the frame
below, lies flat upon it, lengthways, under the opposite sides of the ship’s
bottom; and as the former is intended to slide downwards upon the latter,
carrying the ship along with it, the planes or faces of both are well daubed
with soap and tallow.</p>

<p class='c008'>The necessary preparations for the lanch being made, all the blocks and
wedges, by which the ship was formerly supported, are driven out from under
her keel, till her whole weight gradually subsides upon the platforms above
described, which are accordingly called the <i>ways</i>. The <i>shores</i> and stanchions by
which she is retained upon the stocks till the period approaches for lanching,
are at length cut away, and the screws applied to move her, if necessary.
The motion usually begins on the instant when the shores are cut, and the
ship slides downward along the ways, which are generally prolonged under the
surface of the water, to a sufficient depth, to float her as soon as she arrives
at the farthest end thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship is to be lanched, the ensign, jack, and pendant, are always
hoisted, the last being displayed from a staff erected in the middle of the
ship. Plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. fig. 4. represents a ship of war ready to be lanched from the
stocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The largest ship that ever was lanched in England, is the Britannia, of 100
guns, built at Portsmouth. Ships of the first rate are commonly constructed
in dry docks, and afterwards floated out, by throwing open the flood-gates,
and suffering the tide to enter, as soon as they are finished.</p>

<p class='c008'>LAND-FALL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atterrage</span></i>, the first land discovered after a sea-voyage:
hence it is common for ships, who accost each other at sea, to wish a good
land-fall at parting, by which they imply a discovery of land, at or near
the place whither their course is directed, and which they expect to <i>make</i> by
their journals.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Land-locked</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouclé</span></i>, the situation of a ship which is environed by the
land on all sides in a road, bay, or haven; so as to exclude the prospect of
the sea, unless over some intervening land. See the French word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terre</span></i>, and
the phrases following it.</p>

<p class='c008'>LANGREL, or LANGRAGE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mitrailles</span></i>, a particular kind of shot,
formed of bolts, nails, bars, or other pieces of iron tied together, and
forming a sort of cylinder, which corresponds with the bore of the cannon,
from which it is intended to be discharged. This contrivance is particularly
designed to wound or carry away the masts, or tear the sails and rigging of
the adversary, so as to disable him from flight or pursuit. It is never used
in royal ships, but very often by privateers and merchantmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>LANIARD, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lanier</span></i>, Fr.) a short piece of cord or line, fastened to several
machines in a ship, and serving to secure them in a particular place, or to
manage them more conveniently. Such are the laniards of the gun-ports,
the laniard of the buoy, the laniard of the cat-hook, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal laniards used in a ship, however, are those employed to
extend the shrouds and stays of the masts, by their communication with the
dead-eyes, so as to form a sort of mechanical power, resembling that of a
tackle. See <span class='sc'>Dead-Eyes</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>These laniards, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rides</span></i>, are fixed in the dead-eyes as follows: One end of
the laniard is thrust through one of the holes in the upper dead-eye, and
then knotted, to prevent it from drawing out; the other end is then passed
through one of the holes in the lower dead-eye, whence, returning upward,
it is inserted through the second hole in the upper dead-eye, and next through
the second in the lower dead-eye, and finally through the third holes in
both dead-eyes. The end of the laniard being then directed upwards from the
lowest dead-eye, is stretched as stiff as possible by the application of tackles;
and that the several parts of it may slide with more facility through the
holes in the dead-eyes, it is well smeared with hog’s lard or tallow, so that
the strain is immediately communicated to all the turns at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>LANTHORN, a well-known machine, of which there are many used
in a ship, particularly for the purpose of directing the course of other ships in
a fleet or convoy: such are the poop and top-lanthorns, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>LAP-SIDED, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bordier</span></i>, the state of a ship, which is built in such a manner
as to have one side heavier than the other; and, by consequence, to retain a constant
<i>heel</i>, or inclination towards the heaviest side; unless when she is brought
upright, by placing a greater quantity of the cargo, or ballast, on the other
side. See <span class='sc'>Ballast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>LARBOARD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">babord</span></i>, a name given by seamen to the left side of a
ship, wherein the right and left are apparently determined by the analogy of
a ship’s position, on the water, to that of a fish.</p>

<p class='c008'>LARGE, a phrase applied to the wind, when it crosses the line of a
ship’s course in a favourable direction, particularly on the <i>beam</i> or <i>quarter</i>.
To understand this more clearly, let us suppose a ship steering west; then
the wind, in any point of the compass to the eastward of the south or north,
may be called <i>large</i>, unless indeed when it is directly east, and then it is
said to be right aft.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sailing</i> <span class='sc'>Large</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aller vent largue</span></i>, is therefore advancing with a large wind,
so as that the <i>sheets</i> are slackened and <i>flowing</i>, and the <i>bowlines</i> entirely
disused. This phrase is generally opposed to sailing <i>close-hauled</i>, or with a <i>scant</i>
wind, in which situation the sheets and bowlines are extended as much as
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>LASHING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amarrage</span></i>, a piece of rope employed to fasten or secure any
moveable body in a ship, or about her masts, sails, and rigging: also the act
of fastening or securing any thing by means of the rope used for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>LATEEN-SAIL, a long triangular sail extended by a lateen-yard, and
frequently used by xebecs, polacres, settees, and other vessels navigated in
the Mediterranean sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>LAYING <span class='sc'>the Land</span>, in navigation, the state of motion which increases
the distance from the coast, so as to make it appear lower and smaller; a
circumstance which evidently arises from the intervening convexity of the
surface of the sea. It is used in contradistinction to <i>raising</i> the land, which is
produced by the opposite motion of approach towards it.</p>

<p class='c008'>LEAK, a chink or breach in the decks, sides, or bottom of a ship,
through which the water passes into her hull. When a leak first commences,
the vessel is said to have sprung a leak.</p>

<p class='c008'>LEAKY, the state of a ship when abounding with leaks.</p>

<p class='c008'>LEE, an epithet used by seamen to distinguish that part of the hemisphere
to which the wind is directed, from the other part whence it arises; which
latter is accordingly called <i>to windward</i>. This expression is chiefly used when
the wind crosses the line of a ship’s course, so that all on one side of her is called
<i>to-windward</i>, and all on the opposite side, <i>to leeward</i>: and hence,</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Under the</i> <span class='sc'>Lee</span>, implies farther to the leeward, or farther from that part
of the horizon from whence the wind blows; as,</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Under the</i> <span class='sc'>Lee</span> <i>of the shore</i>; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> at a short distance from the shore which
lies to windward. This phrase is commonly understood to express the situation
of a vessel, anchored, or sailing under the weather-shore, where there
is always smoother water, and less danger of heavy seas, than at a great
distance from it<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lee-larches</span>, the sudden and violent rolls which a ship often takes to
the leeward in a high sea, particularly when a large wave strikes her on the
weather-side.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lee-side</span>, all that part of a ship or boat which lies between the mast, and
the side farthest from the direction of the wind; or otherwise, the half of a
ship, which is pressed down towards the water by the effort of the sails, as
separated from the other half, by a line drawn through the middle of her
length. That part of the ship, which lies to windward of this line, is accordingly
called the <i>weather-side</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus admit a ship to be sailing southward, with the wind at east, then is
her starboard, or right-side, the <i>lee-side</i>; and the larboard, or left, the <i>weather-side</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Leeward-ship</span>, a vessel that falls much to-leeward of her course, when
sailing <i>close-hauled</i>, and consequently loses much ground.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Leeward</span>, towards that part of the horizon which lies under the lee,
or whither the wind bloweth. Thus, “We saw a fleet under the lee,” and,
“We saw a fleet to-leeward,” are synonimous expressions.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lee-way</span>, is the lateral movement of a ship to-leeward of her course, or
the angle which the line of her way makes with the keel when she is <i>close-hauled</i>.
See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>This movement is produced by the mutual effort of the wind and sea
upon her side, forcing her to-leeward of the line upon which she appears to
sail; and in this situation her course is necessarily a compound of the two
motions by which she is impelled, of which the one presses forward, according
to the line of her keel, from H to K, fig. 5. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. whilst the
other, acting in the line B A, pushes her to leeward of the course from B
towards A, with a motion which is usually in proportion to the force of
the wind, and the rate of her velocity, as appears by the following theory.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship is close-hauled, and the head-sails are in perfect equilibrio
with those abaft, the resistance of the water from A to B. fig. 5. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>.
is equal to the impulse of the sails, whether it is impressed upon the centre
of gravity H of the ship, or any other point of her length before or abaft
it. In this situation, the ship will as readily bear away as come nearer to
the wind, with regard to the resistance of the water upon her bottom on one
side, and the impulsion of the wind upon the sails on the other. But it must
be observed, that the united effort of the sails acts upon the ship according
to a direction B A, perpendicular to their surfaces, and commencing its
action in some point H, being the mean <i>d</i> between the different effects C G,
of the sails <i>afore</i> and abaft, which should exactly correspond with the resistance
of the water from A towards B; so that the vessel is pushed to leeward
of the course I K, which she steers in the direction B A of the effort
of the sails. But the resistance of the water, acting upon the lee-side of
her bottom, counterbalances this effort, and becomes stronger, in proportion
to the greater facility with which she divides the fluid with her stem;
so that she will really advance in the course N R, which lies nearer the line
of her keel than B A. Thus the angle K H R of the lee-way is proportional
to the greater or less resistance the ship meets with from the fluid
upon her lee side, respectively with her greater or less facility of dividing it
with her fore-part; so that the lee-way is very inconsiderable, except, when
the ship is close-hauled, and is accordingly disregarded whenever the wind,
is large.</p>

<p class='c008'>This demonstration might be pushed farther by a fact founded on daily
experience, which proves that not only the lee-way depends on the form of
the vessel, but also the degree of velocity with which she advances; and perhaps
never, intirely, upon the greater or less obliquity of the sails with the
keel, as some authors have pretended. For when a swift-sailing ship is
<i>close-hauled</i>, with all her sails out, in a very light wind, and scarcely having
<i>steerage-way</i>, the lee-way is considerable even in smooth water. This is
occasioned by the tardy motion of the vessel, which being feebly pushed forward,
cannot impress the water with a forcible effect, and by consequence
feels no resistance from it, but is accordingly carried with facility by her
sails, in the direction of their effort B A: and if we consider the situation
of the ship’s side, which presents a great surface of sail above the water, it
appears that the lee-way will become yet more perpendicular to the keel. But
when the wind makes a forcible impression, the velocity of moving forward
is considerably augmented; the ship strikes the fluid with a force, expressed
by the square of two or three leagues of swiftness, from B towards A, in the
space of an hour, whilst the water repels her effort in a contrary direction.
The resistance of the water is then, in the ratio of this square, to the square
of her first velocity, or head-way; and in this state will not readily yield to
its effort. The lee-way immediately decreases, and will be still farther diminished,
if the ship’s course is accelerated. If then at the moment when the ship
advances with great rapidity, she <i>bears away</i> 12 or 15 degrees, or even two
points, without altering the general arrangement of her sails, their obliquity
remains the same, the ship therefore ought to have the same lee-way, according
to the opinion of those who have written on the theory of sailing. The
velocity is augmented, because the sails then receive the wind by a greater
sine of incidence, and thereby acquire a more powerful effort, whilst the
ship’s <i>head</i> is always struck by the water in the same parts, and by the same
sine of incidence; so that the lee-way is also diminished, because the water
resists more, in consequence of the accelerated swiftness; and because the resistance
is more exerted on the ship’s side than on her head, which is less opposed
to its impulsion. Hence we may conclude, that the lee-way of a ship does
not entirely depend on the disposition of her sails; that it is different in
different vessels, because they are neither formed alike, nor are their sails
equally <i>trimmed</i> in the same oblique courses: and finally, because they have
always a different velocity, at the same time, and under the same sail. Thus
it is evident, that the lee-way is always composed of the ship’s comparative
velocity; of her form, which gives more or less proportional resistance upon the
side than on the fore-part; and of the disposition of her sails, as forming
a greater or smaller obliquity with the keel. See also <span class='sc'>Close-hauled</span>, <span class='sc'>Drift</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>LEECHES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bords</span></i>, the borders or edges of a sail, which are either sloping
or perpendicular. See <span class='sc'>Goring</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The leeches of all sails, whose tops and bottoms are parallel to the deck,
or at right angles with the mast, are denominated from the ship’s side, and
the sail to which they belong; as the <i>starboard</i> leech of the main-sail, the <i>lee</i>
leech of the fore-top-sail, &amp;c. but the sails which are fixed obliquely upon
the masts, have their leeches named from their situation with respect to the
ship’s length; as the fore-leech of the mizen, the after-leech of the jib,
or fore-stay-sail, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Leech-Lines</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cargues-bouline</span></i>, certain ropes fastened to the middle of the
leeches of the main-sail and fore-sail, and communicating with blocks under
the opposite sides of the top, whence they pass downwards to the deck,
serving to truss up those sails to the yard, as occasion requires. See <span class='sc'>Brails</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Leech-rope</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ralingue</span></i>, a name given to that part of the bolt-rope, to
which the border, or skirt of a sail is sewed. In all sails, whose opposite leeches
are of the same length, it is terminated above by the earing, and below by
the clue. See <span class='sc'>Bolt-rope</span>, <span class='sc'>Clue</span>, and <span class='sc'>Earing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>LENGTHENING, the operation of cutting a ship down across the middle,
and adding a certain portion to her length. It is performed by sawing
her planks asunder, in different places of her length, on each side of the midship
frame, to prevent her from being weakened too much in one place.
The two ends are then drawn apart, to a limited distance, which must be
equal to the proposed addition of length. An intermediate piece of timber
is next added to the keel, upon which a sufficient number of timbers are
erected, to fill up the vacancy produced by the separation. The two parts
of the kelson are afterwards united, by an additional piece which is scored down
upon the floor-timbers; and as many beams as may be necessary, are fixed
across the ship in the new interval. Finally, the planks of the side are prolonged,
so as to unite with each other, and those of the ceiling refitted in
the same manner; by which the whole process is completed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Let</span> <i>in</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enclaver</span></i>, amongst shipwrights, is to fix a diminished part of
one plank or piece of timber into a vacancy, formed in another for this purpose.

<p class='c008'>LETTER OF MART, a commission granted by the lords of the admiralty,

<p class='c008'>LIEUTENANT <i>of a ship of war</i>, the officer next in rank and power
to the captain, in whose absence he is accordingly charged with the command
of the ship; as also the execution of whatever orders he may have received
from the commander relating to the king’s service.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lieutenant, who commands the watch at sea, keeps a list of all the
officers and men thereto belonging, in order to muster them, when he judges
it expedient, and report to the captain the names of those who are absent
from their duty. During the night-watch, he occasionally visits the lower
decks, or sends thither a careful officer, to see that the proper centinels are at
their duty, and that there is no disorder amongst the men; no tobacco
smoaked between decks, nor any fire or candles burning there, except the
lights which are in lanthorns, under the care of a proper watch, on particular
occasions. He is expected to be always upon deck in his watch, as
well to give the necessary orders, with regard to <i>trimming</i> the sails and superintending
the navigation, as to prevent any noise or confusion; but he is
never to change the ship’s course without the captain’s directions, unless to
avoid an immediate danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lieutenant, in time of battle, is particularly to see that all the men
are present at their quarters, where they have been previously stationed according
to the regulations made by the captain. He orders and exhorts
them every where to perform their duty, and acquaints the captain at all
other times of the misbehaviour of any persons in the ship, and of whatever
else concerns the service or discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>The youngest lieutenant of the ship, who is also stiled lieutenant at arms,
besides his common duty, is particularly ordered, by his instructions, to
train the seamen to the use of small arms, and frequently to exercise and
discipline them therein. Accordingly his office, in time of battle, is chiefly
to direct and attend them, and at all other times to have a due regard to the
preservation of the small arms, that they be not lost or embezzled, and that
they are kept clean and in good condition for service.</p>

<p class='c008'>LIFTS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balanciers</span></i>, certain ropes, descending from the cap and mast-head,
to the opposite extremities of the yard immediately under; where, passing
through a block or pulley, they become double. They are used to keep
the yard in equilibrio; or to pull one of its extremities higher than the other,
as occasion requires; but particularly to support the weight of it, when a
number of seamen are employed thereon, to furl or <i>reef</i> the sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lifts of the top-sail-yards, called the top-sail-lifts, are also used as
<i>sheets</i> to extend the bottom of the top-gallant-sail above.</p>

<p class='c008'>The yards are said to be squared by the lifts, when they hang at right
angles with the mast; that is to say, parallel to the horizon, when the vessel
is upright upon the water.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Topping</i>-<span class='sc'>Lift</span>.  See <span class='sc'>Topping-Lift</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>LIGHT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lege</span></i>, in the sea-language is used in contradistinction to laden.
A ship is accordingly called light, either when she has no cargo, or when
she is not sufficiently ballasted.</p>

<p class='c008'>LIGHTER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">allege</span></i>, a large, open, flat-bottomed vessel, generally managed
with oars, and employed to carry goods to or from a ship when she is to be
laden or delivered. See the article <span class='sc'>Vessel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are also some lighters furnished with a deck throughout their whole
length, in order to contain those merchandizes, which would be damaged by
rainy weather: these are usually called close-lighters.</p>

<p class='c008'>LIGHT-HOUSE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">phare</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour à feu</span></i>, a sort of tower erected upon a
cape or promontory on the sea-coast, or upon some rock in the sea, and
having a great fire, or light formed by candles, upon its top, in the night
time, which is constantly attended by some careful person, so as to be seen
at a great distance from the land. It is used to direct the shipping on the
coast, that might otherwise run ashore, or steer an improper course, when
the darkness of the night, and the uncertainty of currents, &amp;c. might render
their situation, with regard to the shore, extremely doubtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>LIGHT-ROOM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fanal de soute</span></i>, a small apartment, inclosed with glass
windows, near the magazine of a ship of war. It is used to contain the
lights by which the gunner, and his assistants, are enabled to fill the cartridges
with powder, to be ready for action.</p>

<p class='c008'>LIMBERS, or LIMBER-HOLES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parclosses</span></i>, certain square holes cut
through the lower parts of a ship’s floor-timbers, very near the keel. Being
disposed in a line, parallel to the keel, they form a channel, which communicates
with the pumps throughout the whole length of the floor, so that
the water which enters by a leak, and would otherwise be intercepted by
the timbers, is easily conveyed to the well-room, where the pumps are fixed.
Every floor-timber has two limber-holes cut through it, viz. one on each
side of the <i>kelson</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Limber-Boards</span>, short pieces of plank, which form a part of the ceiling,
or lining of a ship’s floor, close to the kelson, and immediately above
the limbers. They are occasionally removed, when it becomes necessary,
to examine, or clear the limber-holes of any filth, sand, chips, or gravel, by
which they may be clogged, so as to interrupt the passage of the water, in
the ship’s floor, to the pump-well.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Limber-Rope</span>, a long rope, frequently retained in the limber-holes of a
ship, and communicating from one to another, in order to clear them by
pulling the rope backwards and forwards, so as to loosen the sand or dirt
by which they may occasionally be choaked.</p>

<p class='c008'>LINE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ligne</span></i>, a general name given to the arrangement or order in which
a fleet of ships of war are disposed to engage an enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disposition, which is the best calculated for the operations of naval
war, is formed by drawing up the ships in a long file, or right line, prolonged
from the keel of the hindmost to that of the foremost, and passing
longitudinally through the keels of all the others, from the van to the rear;
so that they are, according to the sea-phrase, in the <i>wake</i> of each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the line, or order of battle, all the ships of which it is composed are
<i>close-hauled</i>, upon the starboard or larboard-tack, about 50 fathoms distant
from each other. See plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. fig. 5. where <i>a b</i> represents the elevation, and
A B the plan of this order, upon the starboard-tack; the direction of the
wind in both being expressed by the arrow in the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fleet is more particularly drawn up in the line when in presence of an
enemy. It ought to be formed in such a manner as that the ships should
mutually sustain and reinforce each other, and yet preserve a sufficient space
in their stations, to <i>work</i> or direct their movements with facility during
the action. Thus they will be enabled effectually to cannonade the enemy,
without incommoding the ships of their own squadron.</p>

<p class='c008'>The line close-hauled is peculiarly chosen as the order of battle, because
if the fleet, which is to windward, were arranged in any other line, the enemy
might soon gain the <i>weather-gage</i> of it; and even if he thinks it expedient
to decline that advantage, it will yet be in his power to determine the
distance between the adverse fleets, in an engagement, and to compel the
other to action. The fleet to leeward, being in a line close-hauled, parallel
to the enemy, can more readily avail itself of a change of the wind, or of the
neglect of its adversary, by which it may, by a dextrous management, get to
windward of him: or, should it fail in this attempt, it will nevertheless be
enabled, by the favourable state of the wind, to avoid coming to action, if
the enemy is greatly superior; or to prevent him from escaping, if he should
attempt it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides these advantages, this order of battle is singularly convenient and
proper in other respects. The sails of each ship are disposed in such a manner
as to counter-act each other, so that the ships in general neither advance
or retreat during the action. By this circumstance they are enabled to retain
their stations with greater stability, and to prosecute the battle with vigour
and resolution, yet without perplexity and disorder. The uniformity of the
line will be preserved, so that the admiral’s orders may be readily communicated
by signals from the van to the rear. The distress of any particular
ship, that is disabled and rendered incapable to continue the action,
will be presently discovered, and her place accordingly supplied by one of
the ships in reserve. The circumstances and situation of the enemy’s line
will be ever open to the view of the commander in chief, so that he may be
enabled to convert any disaster that may happen therein to his own advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be alledged indeed, that the same reasons hold good with regard to
the enemy, to whom this arrangement will be equally beneficial. It may
also be observed, that particular occasions have rendered it necessary to
break the order of the line; and that sometimes this expedient has been
practised with equal judgment and success. To the first of these allegations
it may be answered, that in war as well as politics, there are certain general
rules absolutely necessary to be observed by the hostile powers: rules which
are founded on mutual convenience, and authorised by the invariable
example of all ages! Whatever tends to facilitate the designs of the adverse
parties on each other, or whatever operates to shorten the period of war,
and render it less destructive and fatal, are objects which ought never to be
disregarded. Disorder has not only a tendency to protract the war, but to
make it more bloody and ruinous, and to aggravate all the calamities with
which it is inseparably attended. Perhaps this observation is particularly
applicable to our present purpose, unless the consequences of disorder in a
sea-fight, as related below, should rather be considered as the creation of
fancy, than a recital of facts, naturally resulting from known causes. Although
peculiar circumstances have sometimes, by their success, justified the
measure of engaging an enemy’s fleet, without forming the line; or after the
line has been separated; there is nevertheless very few operations in war that
require greater delicacy and vigilance, if the hostile fleets are very near to each
other. Perhaps no military enterprize can be attended with greater hazard,
or with fewer hopes of success. The incessant fire of so large an assembly
of ships in a very short time covers the scene of action with a cloud of
smoke, which is constantly accumulating. The winds that enabled the two
fleets to approach each other are soon become extremely feeble, or perhaps
perfectly lulled, by the explosions of a vigorous cannonade: they are of course
incapable any longer to dissipate the smoke, which then darkens the air, and is
almost impenetrable to the eye. If in this situation the hostile ships are
promiscuously scattered amongst each other, it is easy to foretel the mischief,
perplexity, and distraction, to which the whole will be inevitably exposed.
Not only is the most comprehensive skill of the commander in chief
rendered useless; the smaller ships, abandoned to their ill fortune, may be
torn to pieces by superior force, without relief or succour: and, what is infinitely
worse than all, the ships of the same fleet may cannonade each other,
with all the resolution and spirit which they exert against their enemies!
If the design of war is conquest, and not massacre, it is thus totally perverted!
The battle, instead of being brought to a speedy issue, and decided
by a victory and defeat, is unhappily protracted into a scene of slaughter
and ruin, equally fatal and undecisive to both parties.</p>

<p class='c008'>If then disorder and confusion are fraught with such dangerous consequences
in a naval armament, it is no less certain that the principal sinews of
its strength are discipline, regularity, vigilance, and activity. It has been
already remarked, that the ships of the line should be sufficiently close, to
sustain each other; for if they are farther apart than those of the enemy’s line,
many single ships will suffer the fire of two at once. Hence the fleet is
rendered inferior to that of the enemy, at the onset of battle; a circumstance
which evinces the superiority of larger ships, accompanied with
weightier metal! the enemy is defeated by the efforts of a more numerous
and more powerful artillery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides these advantages, the larger ships are in other respects highly preferable
in a line of battle. They overlook those of an inferior rate, which
are accordingly laid open to the fire of their musquetry. In a high sea
they can more safely employ the artillery of their lower deck than a smaller
ship; and if both are obliged to shut their lower deck ports, the advantage
of the three-decked ships, with regard to their cannon, will yet be considerable:
they have three tier against two, and two against one. The same
superiority subsists, in case they are dismasted, when the upper-deck is encumbered
with the ruins.</p>

<p class='c008'>The large ships, being higher <i>between-decks</i>, are less incommoded with
the smoke; and their cannon is managed with greater facility.</p>

<p class='c008'>The large ships, having greater solidity of frame, are better calculated to
resist the effects of battle and tempest. In general also, they sail better than
the small ones, except in fine weather; for in a fresh wind, when the sea
becomes agitated, they have always the superiority.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fire-ships do not succeed so well against large ships as the smaller ones:
the artillery will sink them, or oblige them sooner to relinquish their design;
and they are easily <i>towed</i> away by the great long boats.</p>

<p class='c008'>The line of a fleet, which has abundance of capital ships, need not be
so much enclosed as that of an enemy who has fewer. The former may be
also less numerous, without being weaker.</p>

<p class='c008'>An open line will, on many occasions, work more easily than one which
is more enclosed; and if it is less numerous, the movements thereof are more
expeditious; the signals better attended; the general order more exactly
preserved; and the ships less liable to be separated. Hence it will be less
embarrassed by a change of wind, and the order will be sooner re-established.</p>

<p class='c008'>A less numerous line will more readily approach or escape from an enemy,
or a hostile shore; and, finally, when cruizing in a smaller space, it will not
be so much contracted.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the preceding reflections it results, that the line, which contains
more capital ships, will be stronger than one more numerous, if composed of
smaller ships. This reflection however does not exclude a certain number
of the third and fourth <i>rates</i>, which are necessary in all naval armaments<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the hostile fleets are drawn up in two opposite lines, with their sides to
the wind, it is evident that one must be to the leeward of the other, as appears
in fig. 8. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. Both situations however have their defects as well
as advantages.</p>

<p class='c008'>The advantages of a weather-line are generally, that it may approach the
enemy so as to determine the time and distance of action. If it is more
numerous than the lee-line, it may easily appoint a detachment to fall upon
the van and rear of the latter, and enclose it between two fires. It is little
incommoded by the fire or smoke of the cannon, and may dispatch the fire-ships,
under cover of the smoke, upon the disabled ships of the lee-line; or
wheresoever they may occasion perplexity and disorder, by obliging the
enemy to break the line and <i>bear away</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The weather-line has nevertheless its defects, which sometimes counterbalance
the advantages above recited. If the sea is rough, and the wind
boisterous, it cannot readily fight with the lower-deck battery. It cannot
decline the action without the dangerous expedient of forcing through the
enemy’s line: and if it <i>keeps the wind</i>, the lee-line may enclose, and totally destroy
it, especially if it is inferior in number to the latter; or if the ships thereof
are in bad condition; for it then can find no other resource but in the dexterity
of its manœuvres, unless it is favoured by the wind, or any oversight
of the enemy. The disabled ships of the weather-line must tack, to avoid
falling into the enemy’s fleet; and if they are much shattered, they may be
altogether separated from their own fleet, particularly if they are in the rear
of the line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The line to leeward has also its advantages, which have occasionally been
preferred to those of the weather-line. The ships of the former may use
the guns of their lower decks, without the hazard of taking in much water
at the ports in stormy weather; whereas the line to windward dare not open
them, without the greatest danger. If the lee-line, although more numerous,
cannot so easily <i>double</i> upon the van and rear of the enemy, and inclose them
between two fires, it may nevertheless have opportunities of tacking, and
cutting off a part of the enemy’s rear, by obliging them to bear away, or
separate from the rest. The disabled ships to leeward are much more readily
removed from the line than those to windward, without being obliged
to tack and continue exposed to the enemy’s fire: they bear away, and
remain at a competent distance from the fleet in a state of safety. Finally,
the lee-line can with more facility avoid the action than its adversary;
a circumstance which is extremely favourable to an inferior squadron.</p>

<p class='c008'>The defects of the lee-line, on the contrary, are, that it cannot decide
the time and distance of the battle, which may commence before it is sufficiently
formed; and it will perhaps be attacked by an enemy, who bears
away upon it in regular order. The fire and smoke of the weather-line are
a great inconvenience to it; and it cannot easily break the enemy’s line with
its fire-ships, which are very slowly and with great difficulty conveyed to
windward.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be remarked, that the admiral’s ship attentively preserves her station
in the centre of the line; for if the commander in chief should give
way to the caprice or inattention of any of those under his direction, it
would introduce an endless disorder into the squadron.</p>

<p class='c008'>To illustrate this article, and enable the reader to form a clearer idea of
the line, we have, in plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. represented several distinct views, according
to the different situations which it occasionally assumes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 7. exhibits a perspective view of the line of battle on the starboard-tack,
A B being the plan thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 8. <i>a</i>, represents the profile of the same line on the starboard-tack, as
brought to action by the opposite line <i>b</i>. The plan of these squadrons,
A B, appears immediately below.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is necessary to remark here, that a fleet frequently retains the order of
the same tack, occasionally, when the whole fleet goes about at once, as expressed
by <i>a</i>, fig. 9. of which A is the plan. Or it goes about gradually,
the headmost ship having <i>tacked</i> first, and the next tacked as soon as she arrived
in her wake; the rest following the same example. See <i>c</i>, fig. 7. and
C in the plan of the same figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>It also frequently preserves the order of the line close-hauled, although
steering with a large wind, either in pursuit of a flying enemy, or proceeding
in a particular course. Thus the fleet <i>b</i>, fig. 10. although ranged so as to
be in a line upon the larboard-tack, if close to the wind, is chacing the fleet
<i>a</i> to leeward, which is either parallel to the former and preserving the same
order, or sails on a line abreast, as expressed by the plan C. See also the
article <span class='sc'>Abreast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 11 exhibits a fleet formed into a line, on the starboard-tack, bearing
away upon the continuation of the same line astern. Thus supposing them
to be formed on the starboard-tack, and sailing due north, in a line ahead; it
is evident that if every ship, at one and the same time, bears away and steers
south, the whole fleet will again be upon a line ahead, with the wind upon
the larboard-quarter, as expressed in this figure, and in the plan under it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 12 represents a fleet bearing away, and having half of its ships ranged
on the starboard-tack, and the other half on the larboard-tack, so as to form
the two sides of the angle <i>b c a</i>, of which the commander in chief <i>a</i> makes
the central point. This disposition is sometimes used to force through a
passage which is guarded by an enemy. See also the plan thereof, A B C
below, where it is evident that the admiral is the foremost ship, whilst bearing
away, although she would be the last in both lines, if they were close-hauled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 13 expresses the order of retreat, which is frequently practised by the
French, and is directly the reverse of this; because the angular point is
farthest to leeward in the former, whereas it is to windward of both lines in
the latter; being also the headmost of both, when close-hauled, although the
sternmost ship while they are bearing away.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an engagement, the ships are generally <i>brought-to</i>, with the main-top-sails
laid aback, and their fore-top-sails full, for the purpose of bearing
away more readily, when occasion requires. This disposition of the sails is
represented in fig. 13. plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. See also <span class='sc'>Lying-to</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The line is said to be formed abreast, when the ships sides are all parallel
to each other, on a line which crosses their keels at right angles. This is
more frequently used in pursuing or retreating, with the wind right aft, so
that the line forms a perpendicular with the direction of the wind, as exhibited
by the ships C, in the plan annexed to fig. 10.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Line</span> is also a name given to several small cords, of different sizes, and
used for various purposes at sea; as house-line, marline, rattling-line, &amp;c.
See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>LINTSTOCK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baton à feu</span></i>, a staff about three feet long, having a sharp
point at one end, and a sort of fork or crotch in the other; the latter of

occasionally stuck in the deck, in an upright position. It is frequently used
in small vessels, in an engagement, where there is commonly one fixed
between every two guns, by which the match is always kept dry and ready
for firing.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Shot</i>-LOCKER. See <span class='sc'>Garland</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>LOG, a machine used to measure the ship’s head-way, or the rate of her
velocity as she advances through the sea. It is composed of a reel and line,
to which is fixed a small piece of wood, forming the quadrant of a circle.
The term log however is more particularly applied to the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The log, fig. 14, plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. is generally about a quarter of an inch thick, and five
or six inches from the angular point <i>a</i> to the circumference <i>b</i>. It is balanced
by a thin plate of lead, nailed upon the arch, so as to swim perpendicularly
in the water, with about ⅔ immersed under the surface. The line is fastened
to the log by means of two legs <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, fig. 15, one of which passes through a
hole <i>a</i> at the corner, and is knotted on the opposite side; whilst the other leg
is attached to the arch by a pin <i>b</i>, fixed in another hole, so as to draw out
occasionally. By these legs the log is hung in equilibrio, and the line, which,
is united to it, is divided into certain spaces, which are in proportion to an
equal number of geographical miles, as a half minute or quarter minute is to
an hour of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>This instrument is employed to measure the ship’s course in the following
manner: The reel, fig. 16, about which the log-line is wound, being held
by one man, and the half-minute glass by another, the mate of the watch
at the same time fixes the pin, and throws the log over the stern, which,
swimming perpendicularly in the sea, feels an immediate resistance as the
ship advances. To prevent the pin from being drawn by the effort of this
resistance, the person who heaves the log continually slackens the line over
the stern, or quarter, so that it becomes almost straight on the water, and
the log continues nearly in the same place where it first alighted, and is considered
as fixed therein. The knots are measured from a mark fastened at
the distance of 12 or 15 fathoms from the log; the glass is therefore turned
at the instant when this mark passes over the stern, and as soon as the
glass runs out, the line is accordingly stopped; when the water, acting forcibly
on the surface of the log, immediately dislodges the pin, so that the
log, no longer resisting the effort of the water, is easily drawn aboard. The
degree of the ship’s velocity is then readily determined, by examining the
number of knots nearest to that part of the line, where it was stopped at the
expiration of the glass, as the knots increase in their natural order from the
mark above mentioned. The space comprehended between that mark and
the log is used to let the latter be far enough astern, to be out of the eddy
of the ship’s <i>wake</i> when the glass is turned.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the glass runs thirty seconds, the distance between the knots should
be fifty feet. When it runs more or less, it should therefore be corrected
by the following analogy: As 30 is to 50, so is the number of seconds of
the glass to the distance between the knots upon the line. As the heat or
moisture of the weather has often a considerable effect on the glass, so as
to make it run slower or faster, it should be frequently tried by the vibrations
of a pendulum. The line, being also liable to relax or shrink from the
same cause, ought likewise to be measured, as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usual to heave the log once every hour in ships of war and East-India
men; and in all other vessels, once in two hours; and if at any time
of the watch, the wind has increased or abated in the intervals, so as to affect
the ship’s velocity, the officer generally makes a suitable allowance for it,
at the close of the watch.</p>

<p class='c008'>LOG-BOARD, a sort of table, divided into several columns, containing
the hours of the day and night, the direction of the winds, the course of
the ship, and all the material occurrences that happen during the twenty-four
hours, or from noon to noon; together with the latitude by observation.
From this table the different officers of the ship are furnished with materials
to compile their journals, wherein they likewise insert whatever may have
been omitted; or reject what may appear superfluous in the log-board. See
the article <span class='sc'>Journal</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Log-Book</span>, a book into which the contents of the log-board is daily
copied at noon, together with every circumstance deserving notice, that may
happen to the ship, or within her cognizance, either at sea or in a harbour,
&amp;c. The intermediate divisions or watches of the log-book, containing four
hours each, are usually signed by the commanding officer thereof, in ships
of war or East-Indiamen.</p>

<p class='c008'>LONG-BOAT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaloupe</span></i>, the largest and strongest boat belonging to any
ship. It is principally employed to carry great burthens, as anchors, cables,
ballast, &amp;c. See the article <span class='sc'>Boat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>LOOF, the after-part of a ship’s bow; or that part of her side forward
where the planks begin to be incurvated into an arch, as they approach the
<i>stem</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>LOOK-OUT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">découverte</span></i>, a watchful attention to some important object,
or event, which is expected to arise from the present situation of a ship,
&amp;c. It is principally used in navigation, when there is a probability of
danger from the real or supposed proximity of land, rocks, enemies, and,
in short, whatever peril she may encounter, through inattention, which might
otherwise have been avoided by a prudent and necessary vigilance.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is always a look-out kept on a ship’s forecastle at sea, to watch
for any dangerous objects lying near her track, and to which she makes a
gradual approach as she advances: the mate of the watch accordingly calls
often from the quarter-deck, “Look out afore there!” to the persons appointed
to this service.</p>

<p class='c008'>LOOMING, an indistinct appearance of any distant object, as the sea-coast,
ships, mountains, &amp;c. as, “she looms large afore the wind; the looming
of the land is high above the water,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>LOOP-HOLES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">meurtrieres</span></i>, certain small apertures, formed in the <i>bulk-heads</i>
and other parts of a merchant-ship, through which the small arms are
fired on an enemy who boards her.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> LOOSE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deferler</span></i>, to unfurl or call loose any sail, in order to be <i>set</i>,
or dried, after rainy weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>LOST, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé</span></i>, the state of being foundered or cast away; expressed of a
ship when she has either sunk at sea, or struck upon a rock, shelf, or lee-shore,
where she has beat to pieces by the violence of the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>LOW-WATER, that state of the tide, in which the reflux has fallen to
its greatest depression from the sea-coasts, or rivers of any country. See the
article <span class='sc'>Tide</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> LOWER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amener</span></i>, to ease down gradually, expressed of some weighty
body, which is suspended by tackles, or other ropes, which, being slackened,
suffer the said body to descend as slowly or expeditiously as the occasion
requires. Hence</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Lower</span> <i>handsomely</i>! and <i>lower cheerly!</i> are opposed to each other, the
former being the order to lower gradually, and the latter to lower expeditiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>LUFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lof</span></i>, the order from the pilot to the steersman to put the helm
towards the <i>lee</i>-side of the ship, in order to make the ship sail nearer the
direction of the wind. Hence, luff round, or luff alee, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">envoie, lof tout</span></i>, is
the excess of this movement, by which it is intended to throw the ship’s head
up in the wind, in order to tack her, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship is accordingly said to spring her luff, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire une olofée</span></i>, when she
yields to the effort of the helm, by sailing nearer to the line of the wind
than she had done before. See also <span class='sc'>Hauling</span> <i>the wind</i>, and <span class='sc'>Steering</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Luff-Tackle</span>, a name given by sailors to any large tackle that is not
destined for a particular place, but may be variously employed as occasion
requires. It is generally somewhat larger than the <i>jigger-tackle</i>, although
smaller than those which serve to hoist the heavier materials into and
out of the vessel; which latter are the main and fore-tackles, the stay and
quarter-tackles, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>LUG-SAIL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">treou</span></i>, a square sail, hoisted occasionally on the mast of a
boat, or small vessel, upon a yard which hangs nearly at right angles with the
mast. These are more particularly in the barca longas, navigated by the
Spaniards in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c008'>LYING-TO, or <span class='sc'>Lying-by</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en panne</span></i>, the situation of a ship when she is
retarded in her course, by arranging the sails in such a manner as to counteract
each other with nearly an equal effort, and render the ship almost immoveable,
with respect to her progressive motion, or <i>head-way</i>. A ship is
usually <i>brought-to</i> by the main and fore-top-sails, one of which is laid <i>aback</i>,
whilst the other is full; so that the latter pushes the ship forward, whilst
the former resists this impulse, by forcing her astern. This is particularly
practised in a general engagement, when the hostile fleets are drawn up in
two lines of battle opposite each other. It is also used to wait for some other
ship, either approaching or expected; or to avoid pursuing a dangerous
course, especially in dark or foggy weather, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>M.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>MAGAZINE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soute au poudres</span></i>, a close room or store-house, built in the
fore, or after-part of a ship’s hold, to contain the gun-powder used in
battle, &amp;c. This apartment is strongly secured against fire, and no person is
suffered to enter it with a lamp or candle: it is therefore lighted, as occasion
requires, by means of the candles or lamps which are fixed in the <i>light-room</i>
contiguous to it. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>MAGNET. See the article <span class='sc'>Compass</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>MAIN, an epithet usually applied by sailors to whatever is principal, as
opposed to what is inferior or secondary. Thus the main land is used
in contradistinction to an island or peninsula; and the main-mast, the main-wale,
the main-keel, and the main-hatchway, are in like manner distinguished
from the fore and mizen-masts, the channel-wales, the false-keel, and the
fore and after-hatchways, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the sails, yards, and rigging of the main-mast, are all described in their
proper places, namely, under those particular articles, to which the reader
is referred, it will be unnecessary to say any thing farther of them here.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> MAKE, is variously applied, in the sea-language, to the land, to the
sails, to the ship’s course, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Make</span> <i>a good board</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Board</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Make</span> <i>the land</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">decouvrir</span></i>, is to discover it from a distant situation, in
consequence of approaching it after a sea-voyage: as, “In your passage to
cape Tiburon, it will be necessary to make Turk’s Island.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Make</span> <i>sail</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire plus de voiles</span></i>, is to increase the quantity of sail already
extended, either by letting out the <i>reefs</i>, and by hoisting an additional
number of small sails, or by performing either of those exercises separately.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Make</span> <i>sternway</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aller en arriere</span></i>, is to retreat or move with the stern
foremost.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Make</span> <i>water</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire eau</span></i>, usually signifies to leak, unless when the epithet
<i>foul</i> is added thereto. A ship is said to make foul water, when running
in shallow water, her keel disturbs and loosens the mud or ooze, lying at the
bottom thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>MALLET, a sort of wooden hammer, of which there are several sorts
used for different purposes on ship-board, as the</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Calking</i>-<span class='sc'>Mallet</span>, an implement chiefly employed to drive the oakum into
the <i>seams</i> of a ship, where the edges of the planks are joined to each other
in the sides, decks, or bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>The head of this mallet is long and cylindrical, being hooped with iron to
prevent it from splitting in the exercise of calking.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Serving</i>-<span class='sc'>Mallet</span>, a mallet used in <i>serving</i> the rigging, by binding the
spun-yarn more firmly about it, than could possibly be done by hand; which is
performed in the following manner: the spun-yarn being previously rolled
up in a large ball, or clue, two or three turns of it are passed about the rope
and about the body of the mallet, which for this purpose is furnished with a
round channel in its surface, that conforms to the convexity of the rope intended
to be served. The turns of the spun-yarn being strained round the mallet,
so as to confine it firmly to the rope, which is extended above the deck, one
man passes the ball continually about the rope, whilst the other, at the same
time, winds on the spun-yarn by means of the mallet, whose handle acting
as a lever, strains every turn about the rope as firm as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>MANGER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gatte</span></i>, a small apartment, extending athwart the lower-deck
of a ship of war, immediately within the hause-holes, and fenced on the afterpart
by a partition, which separates it from the other part of the deck behind
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>This partition serves as a fence to interrupt the passage of the water,
which occasionally gushes in at the hause-holes, or falls from the wet cable
whilst it is heaved in by the capstern. The water, thus prevented from running
aft, is immediately returned into the sea, by several small channels,
called <i>scuppers</i>, cut through the ship’s side within the manger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The manger is therefore particularly useful in giving a contrary direction
to the water that enters at the hause-holes, which would otherwise run aft
in great streams upon the lower deck, and render it extremely wet and uncomfortable,
particularly in tempestuous weather, to the men who mess and
sleep in different parts thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>MARINE, a general name for the navy of a kingdom or state; as also
the whole œconomy of naval affairs; or whatever respects the building,
rigging, arming, equipping, navigating, and fighting ships. It comprehends
also the government of naval armaments, and the state of all the persons
employed therein, whether civil or military.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Marines</span>, or <span class='sc'>Marine-Forces</span>, a body of troops employed in the sea-service,
under the direction of the lords of the admiralty.</p>

<p class='c008'>MARLINE, (<i>merlin</i>, Fr.) a small line, somewhat less than house-line,
and used for the same purposes. See <span class='sc'>House-Line</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>MARLING, the act of winding any small line, as marline, spun-yarn,
packthread, &amp;c. about a rope, so that every turn is secured by a sort of knot,
so as to remain fixed in case all the rest should be cut through by friction,
&amp;c. This expedient is much preferable to the winding a line spirally about
a rope for the same purpose, because as the turns are at some distance from
each other, the same quantity of line will serve for the one method as the
other; with this difference, that if one of the spiral turns are cut through,
the whole will be rendered useless, whereas by marling, this is entirely
prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marling is commonly used to fasten slips of canvas, called <i>parsling</i>, upon
the surface of a rope, to prevent it from being galled by another rope that
rubs against it, to attach the foot of a sail to its bolt-rope, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Marling-Spike</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">epissoir</span></i>, an iron pin, tapering to a point, and furnished
with a large round head. It is principally used to penetrate the twists, or
strands of a rope, in order to introduce the ends of some other through the
intervals, in the act of <i>knotting</i> or <i>splicing</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is also used as a lever, on many other occasions, about the rigging,
particularly in fixing the seizings upon the <i>shrouds</i>, <i>block-strops</i>, <i>clues</i> of the
sails, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> MAROON, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deserter</span></i>, to put one or more sailors ashore upon a desolate
island, under pretence of their having committed some great crime. This detestable
expedient has been repeatedly practised by some inhuman commanders
of merchant-ships, particularly in the West-Indies.</p>

<p class='c008'>MAST, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mât</span></i>, a long round piece of timber, elevated perpendicularly
upon the keel of a ship, to which are attached the yards, the sails, and the
rigging.</p>

<p class='c008'>A mast, with regard to its length, is either formed of one single piece,
which is called a <i>pole-mast</i>, or composed of several pieces joined together,
each of which retains the name of mast separately. The lowest of these is accordingly
named the lower-mast, <i>a</i>, fig. 1. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. the next in height is the
top-mast, <i>b</i>, which is erected at the head of the former; and the highest
is the top-gallant-mast, <i>c</i>, which is prolonged from the upper end of the top-mast.
Thus the two last are no other than a continuation of the first upwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lower-mast is fixed in the ship by an apparatus, described in the
articles <i>hulk</i> and <i>sheers</i>: the foot, or heel of it, rests in a block of timber
called the step, which is fixed upon the <i>kelson</i>; and the top-mast is attached
to the head of it by the <i>cap</i> and the <i>tressel-trees</i>. The latter of these are
two strong bars of timber, supported by two prominencies, which are as
shoulders on the opposite sides of the mast, a little under its upper end:
athwart these bars are fixed the <i>cross-trees</i>, upon which the frame of the top is
supported. Between the lower mast-head, and the foremost of the cross-trees,
a square space remains vacant, the sides of which are bounded by the two
tressel-trees. Perpendicularly above this is the foremost hole in the cap,
whose after-hole is solidly fixed on the head of the lower-mast. The top-mast
is erected by a tackle, whose effort is communicated from the head of
the lower mast to the foot of the top-mast; and the upper end of the latter
is accordingly guided into, and conveyed up through, the holes between the
tressel-trees and the cap, as above mentioned. The machinery by which it is
elevated, or, according to the sea-phrase, <i>swayed-up</i>, is fixed in the following
manner: the top rope <i>d</i>, fig. 2. passing through a block <i>e</i>, which is hooked on
one side of the cap, and afterwards through a hole, furnished with a sheave or
pulley <i>f</i>, in the lower end of the top-mast, is again brought upwards on the
other side of the mast, where it is at length fastened to an eye-bolt in the cap <i>g</i>,
which is always on the side opposite to the top-block <i>e</i>. To the lower end
of the top-rope is fixed the top-tackle <i>h</i>, the effort of which being transmitted
to the top-rope <i>d</i>, and thence to the heel of the top-mast <i>f</i>, necessarily
lifts the latter upwards, parallel to the lower-mast. When the top-mast is
raised to its proper height, fig. 3. the lower end of it becomes firmly wedged
in the square hole, above described, between the tressel-trees. A bar of wood,
or iron, called the <i>fid</i>, is then thrust through a hole <i>i</i> in the heel of it, across
the tressel-trees, by which the whole weight of the top-mast is supported.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same manner as the top-mast is retained at the head of the lower-mast,
the top-gallant-mast is erected, and fixed at the head of the top-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the parts already mentioned in the construction of masts, with
respect to their length, the lower-masts of the largest ships are composed of
several pieces united into one body. As these are generally the most substantial
parts of various trees, a mast, formed by this assemblage, is justly
esteemed much stronger than one consisting of any single trunk, whose internal
solidity may be very uncertain. The several pieces are formed and
joined together, as represented in the section of a lower-mast of this sort,
fig. 4. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. where <i>a</i> is the shaft, or principal piece into which the rest
are fixed, with their sides or faces close to each other. The whole is secured
by several strong hoops of iron, driven on the outside of the mast, <i>a</i>, fig. 1.
where they remain at proper distances.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal articles to be considered in equipping a ship with masts are,
1st, the number; 2d, their situation in the vessel; and 3d, their height above
the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>The masts being used to extend the sails by means of their yards, it is
evident that if their number were multiplied beyond what is necessary, the
yards must be extremely short, that they may not entangle each other in <i>working</i>
the ship, and by consequence their sails will be very narrow, and receive a
small portion of wind. If, on the contrary, there is not a sufficient number
of masts in the vessel, the yards will be too large and heavy, so as not to
be managed without difficulty. There is a mean between these extremes,
which experience and the general practice of the sea have determined; by
which it appears, that in large ships, every advantage of sailing is retained
by three masts and a bowsprit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most advantageous position of the masts is undoubtedly that from
whence there results an equilibrio between the resistance of the water, on the
body of the ship, on one part, and of the direction of their effort on the other.
By every other position this equilibrio is destroyed, and the greatest effort of
the masts will operate to turn the ship horizontally about its direction; a circumstance
which retards her velocity. It is counterbalanced indeed by the helm;
but the same inconvenience still continues; for the force of the wind, having
the resistance of the helm to overcome, is not intirely employed to push the
vessel forward. The axis of the resistance of the water should then be previously
determined, to discover the place of the main-mast, in order to suspend
the efforts of the water equally, and place the other masts so as that their
particular direction will coincide with that of the <i>main-mast</i>. The whole of
this would be capable of a solution, if the figure of the vessel were regular,
because the point, about which the resistance of the water would be in equilibrio,
might be discovered by calculation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the real figure of the ship is considered, these flattering ideas
will instantly vanish. This observation induced M. Saverien to employ a
mechanical method to discover the axis of resistance of the water, which he
apprehended might be used with success in the manner following:</p>

<p class='c008'>When the vessel is lanched, before the places of the masts are determined,
extend a rope A B, fig. 6. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. from the head to the stern. To the
extremities A and B attach two other ropes A D, B C, and apply to the other
ends of these ropes two mechanical powers, to draw the ship according to
the direction B C, parallel to itself. The whole being thus disposed, let
a moveable tube Z, fixed upon the rope A B, have another rope Z R attached
to it, whose other end communicates with a mechanical power R,
equal to the two powers D and C. This last being applied to the same
vessel, in such manner as to take off the effects of the two others by sliding
upon the rope A B, so as to discover some point Z, by the parallelism of
the ropes A D B C feebly extended with the rope Z R; the line Z R will
be the axis of the equilibrium of the water´s resistance, and by consequence
the main-mast should be planted in the point Z.</p>

<p class='c008'>The figures E, E, E, are three windlasses on the shore, by which this experiment
is applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the situation of the other masts, it is necessary, in the
same manner, to discover two points; so that the direction of the two mechanical
powers operating, will be parallel to the axis of resistance R Z already
found.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exact height of the masts, in proportion to the form and size of the
ship, remains yet a problem to be determined. The more the masts are
elevated above the centre of gravity, the greater will be the surface of sail,
which they are enabled to present to the wind; so far an additional height
seems to be advantageous. But this advantage is diminished by the circular
movement of the mast, which operates to make the vessel stoop to its effort;
and this inclination is increased, in proportion to the additional height of
the mast; an inconvenience which it is necessary to guard against. Thus
what is gained upon one hand is lost upon the other. To reconcile these
differences, it is certain, that the height of the mast ought to be determined
by the inclination of the vessel, and that the point of her greatest inclination
should be the term of this height, above the centre of gravity.
See the article <span class='sc'>Trim</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the general practice of determining the height of the masts,
according to the different rates of the ships in the royal navy, the reader is
referred to the article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to secure the masts, and counterbalance the strain they receive
from the effort of the sails impressed by the wind, and the agitation of the
ship at sea, they are sustained by several strong ropes, extended from their
upper-ends to the outside of the vessel, called <i>shrouds</i>, see fig. 5. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are further supported by other ropes, stretched from their heads towards
the fore-part of the vessel. See <span class='sc'>Rigging</span>.</p>

and disposition of the sails, the working of the ship into her station in the
order of battle, and the direction of her movements in the time of action, and
in the other circumstances of danger, are also more particularly under his inspection.
It is likewise his duty to examine the provisions, and accordingly to
admit none into the ship but such as are sound, sweet, and wholsome. He
is moreover charged with the <i>stowage</i>, or disposition of these materials in the

his duty to attend the <i>gangway</i>, when any boats arrive aboard, and
search them carefully, together with their rowers, that no spirituous liquors
may be conveyed into the ship, unless by permission of the commanding
officer. In these several duties he is assisted with proper attendants, called
his corporals, who also relieve the centinels, and one another, at certain
periods.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Master</span>-<i>attendant</i>, an officer in the royal dock-yards, appointed to hasten,
and assist at, the fitting-out or dismantling, removing or securing vessels of
war, &amp;c. at the port where he resides. He is particularly to observe, that
his majesty’s ships are securely moored; and for this purpose he is expected
frequently to review the <i>moorings</i> which are sunk in the harbour, and observe
that they are kept in proper repair to be always ready when occasion requires.
It is also his duty to visit all the ships in <i>ordinary</i>, and see that they
are frequently cleaned and kept in order; and to attend at the general
musters in the dock-yards, taking care that all the officers, artificers, and
labourers, registered in the navy-books, are present at their duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>MAT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coussin</span></i>, a sort of thick web or texture, formed of spun-yarn, or
of a variety of <i>strands</i>, or separate parts of a small rope; or of a number of
rope-yarns twisted into <i>foxes</i>. The foxes are therefore larger or smaller,
as containing a greater or lesser number of rope-yarns, in proportion to the
thickness of the mat intended to be woven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mats are commonly used to fasten upon the outside of such parts of the
standing rigging as are exposed to the friction of other ropes, in extending,
shifting, or trussing up the sails, particularly the lower ones. The largest
and strongest sort of these mats are called <i>panches</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>MATE <i>of a ship of war</i>, an officer under the direction of the master, by
whose choice he is generally appointed, to assist him in the several branches
of his duty. Accordingly he is to be particularly attentive to the navigation
in his watch, &amp;c. to keep the <i>log</i> regularly, and examine the line, and glasses
by which the ship’s course is measured, and to adjust the sails to the wind
in the fore-part of the ship. He is also to have a diligent attention to the
cables, seeing that they are well <i>coiled</i> and kept clean when laid in the <i>tier</i>,
and sufficiently <i>served</i> when employed to ride the ship. Finally, he is to
superintend, and assist at the stowage of the hold, taking especial care that all
the ballast and provisions are properly stowed therein.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mate</span> <i>of a merchant-ship</i>, the officer who commands in the absence of the
master thereof, and shares the duty with him at sea; being charged with
every thing that regards the internal management of the ship, the directing
her course, and the government of her crew.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of mates allowed to ships of war and merchantmen is always
in proportion to the size of the vessel. Thus a first-rate man of war has
six mates, and an East-Indiaman the same number; a frigate of 20 guns, and
a small merchant-ship, have only one mate in each: and the intermediate
ships have a greater or smaller number, according to their several sizes, or
to the services on which they are employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>MESS, a particular company of the officers or crew of a ship, who eat,
drink, and associate together.</p>

<p class='c008'>MESS-MATE, a companion or associate of the above division. See the
article <span class='sc'>Birth</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>MIDSHIP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maitre</span></i>, a term of distinction, applied by shipwrights to several

as all the corresponding pieces, without and within those frames, are also

<p class='c008'>The number of midshipmen, like that of all other officers, is always in
proportion to the size of the ship to which they belong. Thus a first-rate
man of war has twenty-four, and the inferior rates a suitable number in proportion.
No person can be appointed lieutenant, without having previously
served two years in the royal navy in this capacity, or in that of <i>mate</i>, besides
having been at least four years in actual service at sea, either in merchant-ships,

<p class='c008'>As the chief object of our attention has been to facilitate the acquisition
of this intelligence, we have endeavoured to treat those subjects at large, in
the different parts of this work, according to their importance. We have
also sketched the general outlines of the respective charges of all the superior
officers, which, in conformity to the plan of this work, become previous
to this article. Thus the duties of the admiral, the captain, the lieutenant,
and the master, are already explained in their proper places; and whatever
intelligence appears necessary to discharge those offices, is also, in a high
degree, essential to the midshipman. Those officers indeed, as well as
many others, are furnished with suitable instructions to regulate their conduct;
but the midshipman, being invested with no particular charge from the
government, is by consequence omitted in those official regulations. In a
work of this kind, however, the importance of the subject is not always
determined by the superiority of rank or station. If our province is to
communicate instruction, those who are the least informed are certainly the
principal objects thereof, and to them our attention is more peculiarly directed.
Hence the extent of our design comprehends many circumstances which
would be immaterial in general orders and regulations; and hence abundance
of particular directions to respective officers, inserted in those general
regulations, are rejected here as foreign to our purpose. Averse as we are,
on other occasions, to offend the rigid nicety of a critic, by introducing
moral reflections, in a performance dedicated to scientifical description, we
must for once be indulged with a short deviation from the plan hitherto
invariably followed. Happy! if our efforts may in any degree operate to
produce the effects for which they were calculated.</p>

<p class='c008'>On his first entrance in a ship of war, every midshipman has several
disadvantageous circumstances to encounter. These are partly occasioned by
the nature of the sea-service, and partly by the mistaken prejudices of people
in general, respecting naval discipline, and the genius of sailors and their
officers. No character, in their opinion, is more excellent than that of the
common sailor, whom they generally suppose to be treated with great severity
by his officers, drawing a comparison between them not very advantageous
to the latter. The midshipman usually comes aboard tinctured
with these prejudices, especially if his education has been amongst the
higher rank of people; and if the officers happen to answer his opinion, he
conceives an early disgust to the service, from a very partial and incompetent
view of its operations. Blinded by these prepossessions, he is thrown
off his guard, and very soon surprized to find, amongst those honest sailors,
a crew of abandoned miscreants, ripe for any mischief or villainy. Perhaps,
after a little observation, many of them will appear to him equally destitute
of gratitude, shame, or justice, and only deterred from the commission of
any crimes by the terror of severe punishment. He will discover, that the pernicious
example of a few of the vilest in a ship of war are too often apt
to poison the principles of the greatest number, especially if the reins of discipline
are too much relaxed, so as to foster that idleness and dissipation, which
engender sloth, diseases, and an utter profligacy of manners. If the midshipman,
on many occasions, is obliged to mix with these, particularly in the
exercises of extending or reducing the sails in the tops, he ought resolutely
to guard against this contagion, with which the morals of his inferiors may be
infected. He should however avail himself of their knowledge, and acquire
their expertness in managing and fixing the sails and rigging, and never suffer
himself to be excelled by an inferior. He will probably find a virtue in
almost every private sailor, which is entirely unknown to many of his
officers: that virtue is emulation, which is not indeed mentioned amongst
their qualities by the gentleman of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</span></i>, by whom their characters are
often copiously described with very little judgment. There is hardly a
common tar who is not envious of superior skill in his fellows, and jealous
on all occasions to be out-done in what he considers as a branch of his duty!
Nor is he more afraid of the dreadful consequences of whistling in a storm,
than of being stigmatized with the opprobious epithet of <i>lubber</i>. Fortified
against this scandal, by a thorough knowledge of his business, the sailor
will sometimes sneer in private, at the execution of orders, which to him
appear aukward, improper, or unlike a seaman. Nay, he will perhaps be
malicious enough to suppress his own judgment, and by a punctual obedience
to command, execute whatever is to be performed, in a manner which
he knows to be improper, in order to expose the person commanding to
disgrace and ridicule. Little skilled in the method of the schools, he considers
the officer who cons his lesson by rote as very ill qualified for his
station, because particular situations might render it necessary for the said
officer to assist at putting his own orders in practice. An ignorance in this
practical knowledge will therefore necessarily be thought an unpardonable
deficiency by those who are to follow his directions. Hence the midshipman,
who associates with these sailors in the tops, till he has acquired a competent
skill in the service of extending or reducing the sails, &amp;c. will be often
entertained with a number of scurrilous jests, at the expence of his superiors.
Hence also he will learn, that a timely application to those exercises can
only prevent him from appearing in the same despicable point of view, which
must certainly be a cruel mortification to a man of the smallest sensibility.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the midshipman is not employed in these services, which are undoubtedly
necessary to give him a clearer idea of the different parts of his
occupation, a variety of other objects present themselves to his attention.
Without presuming to dictate the studies which are most essential to his improvement,
we could wish to recommend such as are most suitable to the
bent of his inclination. Astronomy, geometry, and mechanics, which are
in the first rank of science, are the materials which form the skilful pilot
and the superior mariner. The theory of navigation is entirely derived from
the two former, and all the machinery and movements of a ship are founded
upon the latter. The action of the wind upon the sails, and the resistance
of the water at the stem, naturally dictate an enquiry into the property of
solids and fluids: and the state of the ship, floating on the water, seems to
direct his application to the study of hydrostatics and the effects of gravity.
A proficiency in these branches of science will equally enlarge his
views, with regard to the operations of naval war, as directed by the efforts
of powder, and the knowledge of projectiles. The most effectual method to
excite his application to those studies is, perhaps, by looking round the
navy, to observe the characters of individuals. By this enquiry he will probably
discover, that the officer, who is eminently skilled in the sciences, will
command universal respect and approbation; and that whoever is satisfied
with the despicable ambition of shining the hero of an assembly, will be the
object of universal contempt. The attention of the former will be engaged
in those studies, which are highly useful to himself in particular, and to the
service in general. The employment of the latter is to acquire those superficial
accomplishments, that unbend the mind from every useful science,
emasculate the judgment, and render the hero infinitely more dextrous at
falling into his station in the dance, than in the line of battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unless the midshipman has an unconquerable aversion to the acquisition
of those qualifications, which are so essential to his improvement, he will
very rarely want opportunities of making a progress therein. Every step he
advances in those meritorious employments, will facilitate his accession to
the next in order. If the dunces, who are his officers or mess-mates, are
rattling the dice, roaring bad verses, hissing on the flute, or scraping discord
from the fiddle, his attention to more noble studies will sweeten the hours
of relaxation. He should recollect that no example from fools ought to
influence his conduct, or seduce him from that laudable ambition which his
honour and advantage are equally concerned to pursue.</p>

<p class='c008'>MIZEN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artimon</span></i>, (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">misana</span></i>, Ital.) the aftermost or hindmost of the fixed
sails of a ship, extended sometimes by a <i>gaff</i>, and sometimes by a <i>yard</i>
which crosses the mast obliquely; the fore-end reaching almost down to the
deck, and the after-end being peeked up as high above the middle of the
yard, where it is attached to the mast. The figure of the mizen is accordingly
a trapezia, or a parallelogram, one of whose corners is cut off by a
diagonal, extended from one of its sides to the opposite corner, which becomes
the <i>peek</i> of the mizen. See the article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>MIZEN-MAST, the mast upon which the mizen and its top-sail and stay-sails
are supported, besides other sails, which are set occasionally, as the <i>driver</i>,
ring-tail, &amp;c. See the article <span class='sc'>Mast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shrouds, stays, and back-stays of this mast, as well as all the running-rigging,
together with its several yards and sails, being described under
the articles <span class='sc'>Shrowd</span>, <span class='sc'>Stay</span>, <span class='sc'>Yard</span>, &amp;c. the reader is referred thither for the
explanations thereof, which are in general applicable also to the same furniture
of both the other masts.</p>

<p class='c008'>MOLE, a name given in the Mediterranean to a long pier, or artificial
bulwark of masonry, extending obliquely across the entrance of a harbour,
in order to break the force of the sea from the vessels which are anchored
within.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mole</span> is also, although improperly, applied to the harbour or haven,
which is formed by the bulwark above described, which is then denominated
the mole-head.</p>

<p class='c008'>MONSOON, a name given to the periodical or trade-winds, which blow
regularly in certain latitudes of the Indian ocean. They continue five or six
months invariably in one direction, and then alter their course, and blow,
during an equal space of time, from a different point of the compass with
the same uniformity.</p>

<p class='c008'>MOORING, the act of confining and securing a ship in a particular
station, by chains or cables, which are either fastened to the adjacent shore,
or to anchors in the bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship may be either moored by the <i>head</i>, or by the head and stern; that
is to say, she may be secured by anchors before her, without any behind:
or she may have anchors out, both before and behind her; or her cables
may be attached to posts, rings, or <i>moorings</i>, which answer the same purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship is moored by the head with her own anchors, they are disposed
according to the circumstances of the place where she lies, and the
time she is to continue therein. Thus wherever a tide ebbs and flows, it is
usual to carry one anchor out towards the flood, and another towards the
ebb, particularly where there is little room to range about; and the anchors
are laid in the same manner, if the vessel is moored head-and-stern in the
same place. The situation of the anchors, in a road or bay, is usually opposed
to the reigning winds, or those which are most dangerous; so that the ship
rides therein with the effort of both her cables. Thus if she rides in a
bay, or road, which is exposed to a northerly wind and heavy sea from the
same quarter, the anchors passing from the opposite <i>bows</i> ought to lie east
and west from each other: hence both the cables will retain the ship in her
station with equal effort against the action of the wind and sea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Moorings</span> are usually an assemblage of anchors, chains, and <i>bridles</i>, laid
athwart the bottom of a river, or haven, to ride the shipping contained
therein.</p>

<p class='c008'>The anchors, employed on this occasion, have rarely more than one fluke,
which is sunk in the river near low-water mark. Two anchors, being fixed
in this manner, on the opposite sides of the river, are furnished with a chain,
extending across from one to the other. In the middle of the chain is a
large square link, whose lower end terminates in a swivel, which turns round
in the chain as about an axis, whenever the ship veers about with the change
of the tide. To this swivel-link are attached the bridles, which are short
pieces of cable, well served, whose upper ends are drawn into the ship, at
the mooring-ports, and afterwards fastened to the masts, or cable-bits.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great number of moorings, of this sort, are fixed in the royal ports, or
the harbours adjacent to the king’s dock-yards, as Deptford, Chatham,
Portsmouth, Plymouth, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>MORTAR, a piece of artillery, shorter and wider than the cannon, and
having a chamber different from the size of its bore.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mortars are used in the attack of a fortified place, by sea, to discharge
bombs or carcases amongst the buildings. The bomb is a great hollow ball,
filled with powder, which, falling into the works of a fortification, &amp;c.
destroys the most substantial buildings by its weight; and, bursting asunder,
creates the greatest disorder and mischief by its splinters.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chambers of mortars are extremely different in their figures, and
each of those figures is defended by better or worse arguments. Thus they
are spherical, cylindrical, conical, bottled, or concave. In reality, nothing
appears to be less determined upon true principles or experiments than the
proportions of the several parts of a mortar<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the sea-mortars, or those which are fixed in the bomb-vessels, are
generally fixed at a much greater distance than is ever required ashore, they
are made somewhat longer, and much heavier, than the land-mortars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. fig. 7. represents a sea-mortar, the principal parts of which are,
A, the chace; B, the reinforce; C, the breech; and D, the trunnions.
The interior part, comprehended between the dotted lines, is called the
bore, wherein the bomb is lodged; and the inner part of the bore, which is
diminished towards the breech, and contains the powder, is termed the
chamber.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Muller, in his Treatise of Artillery, very justly observes, that the
breech of our 13 inch sea-mortars is loaded with an unnecessary weight of
metal. The chamber thereof contains 32 pounds of powder, and at the same
time they are never charged with more than 12 or 15 pounds, by the most
expert officers, because the bomb-vessel is unable to bear the violent shock
of their full charge. Thus the action of the powder is diminished by the vacancy
left in the chamber, which is never above half filled. As a charge of 12 or
15 pounds of powder at most is therefore sufficient, it is evidently proved,
by the theory of powder, that this will produce the greatest effect when
discharged from a mortar with a cylindrical chamber, represented by fig. 8.
He also proves, by a variety of experiments made by Captain Desaguliers
and himself, that the conical chamber, now used, is considerably inferior to
the cylindrical one with the last charge of powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>To facilitate the use of the mortar, it is placed in a solid carriage of timber,
called the bed, whose different parts are strongly bolted together. By means of
this it is firmly secured in its situation, so that the explosion of the powder may
not alter its direction. In the middle of the upper-side of this carriage,
plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. fig. 9. are two semi-circular notches, to receive the trunnions;
over these are fixed two very strong bands of iron, called the cap-squares, <i>a</i>,
the middle of which is bent into a semi-circle, to embrace the trunnions, and
keep them fast in the mortar-bed. The cap-squares are confined to the
timber-work by strong pins of iron, called the eye-bolts, <i>b</i>, into whose upper
ends are driven the keys, chained beneath them. On the fore-part of the
bed a piece of timber is placed transversely, upon which rests the belly of
the mortar, or that part which contains the chamber. The elevation of this
piece, which is called the bed-bolster, is represented by fig. 13. and the plan
by fig. 12. it is used to elevate and support the mortar whilst firing.</p>

<p class='c008'>These beds are placed upon very strong frames of timber, which are fixed
in the bomb-ketch, and represented in fig. 14. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. They are securely
attached to the frames, by means of a strong bolt of iron, fig. 15.
called the pintle, passing perpendicularly through both, and afterwards
through one of the beams of the vessel. Thus the pintle, which passes
through the hole in the centre of the plan, fig. 10. serves as an axis to the
bed; so that the mortar may be turned about horizontally as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>Plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. fig. 9. represents the elevation of the bed of a 10 inch sea-mortar;
fig. 10 is the plan, and 11 the front view thereof; fig. 12 exhibits
the plan, and fig. 13 the elevation of the bed-bolster.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have already observed, that the bomb, which is usually called the
shell by artillery-people, is a great hollow ball, charged with powder. Fig.
16 is a perspective view of the bomb, and fig. 17 a section of it, whereby
the thickness is exhibited. The parts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of the shell are its handles,
by which it is lifted up or removed; and <i>c</i> is the fuse-hole, or aperture,
through which the powder is poured in to charge it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears, by fig. 17, that the lower part of the shell is thickest, by which
it becomes heavier on that side, and accordingly falls thereon, and never on
the fuse. It is also the better enabled thereby to resist the impression of the
powder, by which it is discharged from the mortar. Both of these reasons,
however, Mr. Muller conceives to be immaterial, because nothing but an
absolute stoppage of the air can exhaust the fuses, as their composition
enables them to burn in water, as well as air or earth; and the explosion
of the mortar would not, in his opinion, be able to break them, if they are
equally thick every where. The most proper quantity of powder to charge a
bomb is probably two thirds of the weight which would fill the cavity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fuse of the bomb is represented by <i>c d</i>, fig. 17. It is generally a
conical tube, formed of beech, willow, or some dry wood, and filled with
a composition of sulphur, salt-petre, and mealed-powder. The bomb being
charged, this fuse is inserted in the cavity through the fuse-hole; and when
fired, communicates the fire to the powder in the shell.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fuses for bombs are charged with great care, that nothing may prevent
them from communicating the fire to the powder in the centre of the
bomb. They are driven into the shell so as that only about an inch and a
half comes out beyond the fuse-hole; and then the shell is said to be
fixed.</p>

<p class='c008'>These fuses are also charged long before there is occasion to use them; and that
the composition with which they are filled may not fall out, or be damaged,
by growing damp, the two ends are covered with a composition of tallow,
mixed either with pitch or bees wax. When the fuse is to be put into the
shell, the little end is opened or cut off; but the great end is never opened
till the mortar is to be fired<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the proper quantity of powder, necessary to charge the mortar, is
put into the chamber, it is covered with a wad, well beat down with the
rammer. After this the fixed shell is placed upon the wad, as near the
middle of the mortar as possible, with the fuse-hole uppermost, and another
wad pressed down close upon it, so as to keep the shell firm in its position.
The officer then points the mortar, or gives it the inclination necessary to
carry the bomb to the place designed. When the mortar is thus fixed, the
fuse is opened; the priming-iron is also thrust into the touch-hole of the
mortar to clear it, after which it is primed with the finest powder. This
done, two of the matrosses, or sailors, taking each one of the matches, the
first lights the fuse, and the other fires the mortar. The bomb, thrown out
by the explosion of the powder, is carried to the place intended; and the
fuse, which ought to be exhausted at the instant of the shell’s falling, inflames
the powder contained therein, and bursts the shell into splinters;
which, flying off circularly, occasion incredible mischief wheresoever they
reach.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Necessary orders before a bombardment by sea.</i></h4>

<p class='c015'>When any fixed shells are issued from the tenders, the artillery people on
board are immediately to fix others in their room, and are always to keep
in their tenders the same number they had at first.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shells are to be fixed in the boat appointed to carry them, provided
the weather permits; otherwise, in the safest place on deck, and to be <i>kitted</i>, or
lowered down into a spare rack, which must be in each boat for that purpose.
While the shells are fixing, the powder-room is to be shut, the hatches laid
and well secured against fire, and the place where they are fixed is to be well
watered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shells being carefully examined in order that no spike is left therein,
by which the fuse may be split, the fuses are to be cut the full length, and
to be set home into the shell very strongly.</p>

<p class='c008'>No shells, fixed during the service, are to be kitted; but if any should
be left, when the service is over, they are immediately to be kitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The powder in the bomb-vessels is to be used first; and none to be opened
or measured out, except in the captain’s cabin, the door of which is to be kept
shut during the whole time, and covered with tanned hides, to make it as
secure as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fixed shells in the boats are to be likewise covered from fire or wet
with hair-cloth and tanned hides, with the utmost care.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the service is carried on at night, all the powder is to be ready measured
out in cartridges, which may be kept in the powder-magazine and captain’s
cabin, in the empty powder-barrels and powder-bags; and all the shells
requisite are to be ready. The tin tubes, one powder-horn, and the port-fires;
also the punches and bits for the vents, are to be kept in the captain’s
cabin.</p>

<p class='c008'>No fire or light, except match and port-fires, to be on board either bomb-vessel
or tender during the service.</p>

<p class='c008'>The captain’s cabin and the passage to it; also the way to the magazine
and decks, are to be constantly watered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spunges for the mortars are to be all examined and tried, and if too
large, they are to be cut so as to enter easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vents of the mortars are to be examined, and the punches and tubes
tried in them.</p>

<p class='c008'>A laboratory-chest is to be on board each bomb-vessel, in the captain’s
cabin, in which all the small stores are to be kept.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two tubs of water are to be on deck, for the lightest port-fires and match,
which must be constantly held in them till ordered to fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two careful men are also to be appointed for this service, who are to do
nothing else on any account.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two careful men of the artillery are to be left on board each tender, for
the filling and fixing of the shells.</p>

<p class='c008'>Application must be made to the admiral for two men of war’s boats to
attend on each bomb-ketch and tender, for carrying shells and stores. One of
these is to be loaded with fixed shells, which, when sent to the bomb-vessel,
must remain with her until they are all taken out, which should be only as
they are wanted for loading the mortars; it is then to return to the tender.
The other boat, mean while, will be receiving more fixed shells, and on the
signal given from the bomb-ketch for more shells, must immediately repair
to her with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>A gang of warrant-officers, and eight seamen, are to be at each mortar, to
give whatever assistance may be required.</p>

<p class='c008'>A gang from the navy, with a careful warrant-officer, and a non-commissioned
officer of the artillery, are to have the charge between decks on
board each bomb and tender, to get up the fixed shells that are in the rack;
and a careful person is to remain constantly at the powder-room door, which
must be kept shut as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>When any powder is wanted from the tender for loading the mortar, it
should be measured out in the tender, and the proper charge put into paper-cartridges,
upon which should be written the quantity, and the mortar for
which it is allotted.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the service of mortars should render it necessary to use pound-shots,
200 of them, with a wooden bottom, are to be put into the 13 inch mortar,
and a quantity of powder, not exceeding five pounds; and 100 of the above
shot, with 2½ lb. of powder for the 10 inch mortar, or 3 lb. at most.</p>

<p class='c008'>The howitzer, fig. 18. is a sort of mortar, which is to be fixed horizontally
like a cannon; and has, like the cannon, a wheel-carriage. These pieces,
however, are very rarely used in the sea-service.</p>

to the different charges of powder, the reader is referred to the article
<span class='sc'>Range</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>MOULD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devers</span></i>, a thin flexible piece of timber, used by shipwrights,
as a pattern whereby to form the different curves of the timbers, and other
<i>compassing</i> pieces, in a ship’s frame. There are two sorts of these, namely,
the bend-mould and hollow-mould: the former of these determines the
convexity of the timbers, and the latter, their concavity on the outside, where
they approach the keel, particularly towards the extremities of the vessel.
The figure, given to the timbers by this pattern, is called their <i>bevelling</i>.

outside of a rope, by means of spun-yarn, parsling, &amp;c. as described in the
article <i>puddening</i>. It is used to confine some other securely to the former,
and prevent it from sliding along its surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>These mouses are particularly used on the stays of the lower-mast, to

<p class='c008'>NAVE-LINE, a sort of small tackle, depending from the head of the
main-mast and foremast, and fastened to the middle of the <i>parrel</i> immediately
behind the mast, and communicating with the gears. It is used to keep the
parrel directly opposite to the yard, and particularly whilst hoisting or lowering,
as it would otherwise hang under the yard, and prevent it from being
sufficiently <i>braced</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>NAVIGATION, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">navigation</span></i>, Fr.) the art of directing the movements of
a ship by the action of the wind upon the sails. See the article <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Navigation is then applied, with equal propriety, to the arrangement
of the sails, according to the state of the wind; and to the directing
and measuring a ship’s course by the laws of geometry; or it may comprehend
both, being then considered as the theory and practice thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since every sea-officer is presumed to be furnished with books of navigation,
in which that science is copiously described, it would be superfluous to
enter into a particular detail of it in this place. As it would also be a fruitless
task to those who are entirely ignorant of the rules of trigonometry, it
appears not to come within the limits of our design: and those who are
versed in that science generally understand the principles of navigation already.
It suffices to say, that the course of a ship, and the distance she
has run thereon, are measured by the angles and sides of a right-angled
plain triangle, in which the hypothenuse is converted into the distance; the
perpendicular, into the difference of latitude; the base, into the departure
from the meridian; the angle, formed by the perpendicular and hypothenuse,
into the course; and the opposite angle, contained between the hypothenuse
and base, into its complement of the course.</p>

<p class='c008'>The course of the ship is determined by the <i>compass</i>; and the <i>log-line</i>, or
a solar observation, ascertains the distance. Hence the hypothenuse and
angles are given, to find the base and perpendicular; a problem well known
in trigonometry.</p>

<p class='c008'>That part of navigation, which regards the piloting or conducting a ship
along the sea-coast, can only be acquired by a thorough knowledge of that
particular coast, after repeated voyages. The most necessary articles thereof
are already described in the article <span class='sc'>Coasting</span>: it is sufficient to observe, that
the bearings and distances from various parts of the shore are generally ascertained
in the night, either by <i>light-houses</i>, or by the different depths of the
water, and the various sorts of ground at the bottom; as shells of different
sizes and colours, sand, gravel, clay, stones, ooze, or shingle. In the day,
the ship’s place is known by the appearance of the land, which is set by the
compass, whilst the distance is estimated by the master or pilot.</p>

<p class='c008'>NAVY (from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">navis</span></i>, Lat.) implies, in general, any fleet or assembly of
ships. It is, however, more particularly understood of the fleet of vessels
of war, that belong to a kingdom or state, to be employed either in assaulting
and destroying its enemies, or protecting its commerce, and defending
its coasts against hostilities or invasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The navy of Great-Britain, together with its civil and military departments,
is governed by the lord high-admiral, or the lords commissioners for
executing this office. It is divided into several classes, or orders, in proportion
to the size of the ships, &amp;c. See the article <span class='sc'>Rate</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the only objects to be considered in the distribution of the navy, into
different rates, were to improve ship-building, and facilitate the operations
of the marine, it might appear expedient to multiply the rates, much beyond
their present number, which would oblige the shipwrights to study the
principles of their art with more diligence and application. But the simplicity
of the service in our dock-yards, and the views of œconomy, which
ought never to be neglected when they regard important objects, has rendered
it convenient to arrange the masts, the yards, the sails, the rigging,
and artillery, into six rates; which, besides that of sloops of war, answers
all the purposes of the navy. See <span class='sc'>Dock-Yards</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Navy</span> is also the collective body of officers employed in his majesty’s
sea-service.</p>

<p class='c008'>NEAPED, (from <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">nepflod</span></i>, Sax.) the situation of a ship which is left aground
on the height of a spring-tide, so that she cannot be floated off till the return
of the next spring. See <span class='sc'>Tide</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>NEEDLE, See the article <span class='sc'>Compass</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>NETTING, a sort of fence, formed of an assemblage of ropes, fastened
across each other, so as to leave uniform intervals between. These are usually
stretched along the upper-part of a ship’s quarter, and secured in this position
by <i>rails</i> and <i>stanchions</i>. See <span class='sc'>Quarter</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>NIPPERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garcettes de tournevire</span></i>, certain pieces of flat, braided cordage,
used to fasten the cable to the <i>voyal</i> in a ship of war, when the former is
drawn into the ship by mechanical powers applied to the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>These nippers are usually six or eight feet in length, according to the size
of the cable; and five or six of them are commonly fastened about the
cable and voyal at once, in order to be heaved in by the capstern. Those
which are farthest aft are always taken off, as the cable approaches the main
hatchway; and others are at the same time fastened on, in the fore-part
of the ship, to supply their places. The persons employed to bind the
nippers about the cable and voyal, are called nipper-men: they are assisted
in this office by the boys of the ship, who always supply them with nippers,
and receive the ends of those which are fastened, to walk aft with them, and
take them off at the proper place, in order to return them to the nipper-men.</p>

<p class='c008'>NITTLES. See <span class='sc'>Knittles</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>NO NEARER! (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrive!</span></i>) the command given by the pilot, or quarter-master,
to the helmsman, to steer the ship no higher to the direction of the
wind than the sails will operate to advance the ship in her course. It is often
abbreviated into <i>no near</i>, and sometimes into <i>near</i>; and is generally applied
when the sails shake in the wind. See <span class='sc'>Shivering</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>NO MAN’S LAND, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Aubinet</span></i>, a space between the after-part of the
belfrey and the fore-part of a ship’s boat, when the said boat is stowed upon
the booms, as in a <i>deep-waisted</i> vessel. These booms are laid from the forecastle
nearly to the quarter-deck, where their after-ends are usually sustained
by a frame called the gallows, which consists of two strong posts, about
six feet high, with a cross piece, reaching from one to the other, <i>athwart-ships</i>,
and serving to support the ends of those booms, masts, and yards,
which lie in reserve to supply the place of others carried away, &amp;c. The
space called <i>No man’s land</i> is used to contain any blocks, ropes, tackles, &amp;c.
which may be necessary on the forecastle. It probably derives this name
from its situation, as being neither on the starboard nor larboard side of the
ship, nor on the <i>waiste</i> or <i>forecastle</i>; but being situated in the middle, partakes
equally of all those places.</p>

<p class='c008'>NORMAN, a name given to a short wooden bar, thrust into one of the
holes of the windlass in a merchant-ship, whereon to fasten the cable.
It is only used when there is very little strain on the cable, as in a commodious
harbour, when the ship is well sheltered from the wind and tide.</p>

<p class='c008'>NUTS <i>of the anchor</i>, two little prominencies, appearing like short square
bars of iron, fixed across the upper-part of the anchor-shank, to secure the
stock thereof in its place; for which purpose there is a corresponding notch,
or channel, cut in the opposite parts of the stock, of the same dimensions
with the nuts. See the article <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>O.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>OAKHAM, or OAKUM, the substance into which old ropes are reduced,
when they are untwisted, loosened, and drawn asunder. It is
principally used to drive into the seams, or intervals, between the planks of
a ship, to prevent the water from entering. See the article <span class='sc'>Caulking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>White</i> <span class='sc'>Oakum</span>, is that which is formed of untarred ropes.</p>

<p class='c008'>OAR, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rame</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">are</span></i>, Sax.) a long piece of timber, flat at one end, and round
or square at the other, and which being applied to the side of a floating-vessel,
serves to make it advance upon the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>That part of the oar which is out of the vessel, and which enters into the
water, is called the blade, or wash, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plat</span></i>; and that which is within-board, is
termed the loom, whose extremity, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manche</span></i>, being small enough to be grasped by
the <i>rowers</i>, or persons managing the oars, is called the handle.</p>

<p class='c008'>To push the boat or vessel forwards, by means of this instrument, the
rowers turn their backs forward, and, dipping the blade of the oar in the
water, pull the handle <i>forward</i> so that the blade at the same time may move
<i>aft</i> in the water: But since the blade cannot be so moved, without striking the
water, this impulsion is the same, as if the water were to strike the blade
from the stern towards the head: the vessel is therefore necessarily moved according
to this direction. Hence it follows, that she will advance with
the greater rapidity, by as much as the oar strikes the water more forcibly.
Thus it is evident, that an oar acts upon the side of a boat or vessel like a
lever of the second class, whose fulcrum is the station, upon which the oar
rests on the boat’s <i>gunnel</i>. In large vessels, this station is usually called the
<i>row-port</i>; but in lighters and boats it is always termed the <i>row-lock</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To ship the</i> <span class='sc'>Oars</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">armer</span></i>, is to fix them in the row-locks ready for rowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>OBSERVATION, the art of measuring the altitude of the sun or a star,
in order to determine the latitude, or the sun’s azimuth, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>OFF, an expression applied to the movement of a ship, when she sails
out from the shore towards the distant sea. When a ship is beating to
windward, so that by one board she approaches towards the shore, and by
the other sails out to sea-ward, she is said to stand off and on shore, alternately.
Hence,</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Offing</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">largue</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dehors</span></i>, implies out at sea; or at a competent distance from
the shore, and generally out of anchor-ground.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Offward</span>, the situation of a ship which lies aground, and leans off from
the shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>OLERON, a name given to a code of general rules relating to naval
affairs, and formed by Richard I. when he was at the island of Oleron.
These have been frequently esteemed the most excellent sea-laws in the world;
and are still preserved in the black book of the admiralty.</p>

<p class='c008'>OPEN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debouclé</span></i>, the situation of a place which is exposed to the wind and
sea, with little or no shelter for shipping to anchor therein.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Open</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ouvert</span></i>, is also expressed of any distant object, to which the sight
or passage is not intercepted by something lying, or coming between. Thus,
to be open with any place, is to be opposite to it; as the entry of a port,
road, or haven.</p>

<p class='c008'>OPENING, a passage, or streight, between two adjacent coasts or islands.</p>

<p class='c008'>ORDINARY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gardiens</span></i>, the establishment of the persons employed by the
government to take charge of the ships of war, which are <i>laid-up</i> in the several
harbours adjacent to the royal dock-yards. These are principally composed
of the warrant-officers of the said ships, as the gunner, boatswain, carpenter,
deputy-purser and cook, and their servants. There is besides a crew of
labourers enrolled in the list of the ordinary, who pass from ship to ship
occasionally to pump, moor, remove, or clean them, whenever it is necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The term <i>ordinary</i> is also applied, sometimes, to the ships themselves; it
is likewise used to distinguish the inferior sailors from the most expert and
diligent. Thus the latter are rated <i>able</i> on the navy-books, and have
1<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> 4<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> per month whereas those who are rated <i>ordinary</i>, have only 19<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i>
per month.</p>

<p class='c008'>ORLOP, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">over-loop</span></i>, Dutch) <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux-pont</span></i>, a plat-form of planks laid over
the beams, in the hold of a ship of war, whereon the cables are usually coiled,
and the several officers store-rooms contained.</p>

<p class='c008'>OVER-BOARD, the state of being thrown out of a ship, or boat, into
the water whereon she swims: also the act of falling from such a vessel into
the sea, &amp;c. as, the ship sprung a leak, and obliged us to throw the guns
over-board; a heavy sea broke over the deck, and carried two of our men
over-board.</p>

<p class='c008'>OVER-CAST-STAFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trebuchet</span></i>, a scale, or measure, employed by shipwrights
to determine the difference between the curves of those <i>timbers</i> which
are placed near the greatest breadth, and those which are situated near the
extremities of the keel, where the floor rises and grows narrower.</p>

<p class='c008'>OVER-HAULING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parcourir</span></i>, the act of opening and extending the several
parts of a <i>tackle</i>, or other assemblage of ropes, communicating with
blocks or <i>dead-eyes</i>. It is used to remove those blocks to a sufficient distance
from each other, that they may be again placed in a state of action, so as to
produce the effect required. See the article <span class='sc'>Tackle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Over-hauling</span>, is also vulgarly expressed of an examination or inspection
into the condition of a person or thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>OVER-MASTED, the state of a ship, whose masts are too high, or too
heavy, for the weight of her hull to counter-balance.</p>

<p class='c008'>OVER-SETTING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chavirer</span></i>, the act of turning any thing upside-down;
also the movement of a ship when she over-turns, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire capot</span></i>, so that the
keel becomes above the water, and the masts under the surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>OUT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dehors</span></i>, an expression frequently used at sea, implying the situation
of the sails when they are <i>set</i>, or extended, to assist the ship’s course; as
opposed to <i>in</i>; which is also applied, in the contrary sense, to signify that
such sails are furled.</p>

<p class='c008'>OUT-FIT, is generally used to signify the expences of equipping a ship
for a sea-voyage; or of arming her for war, or both together. See <span class='sc'>Fitting-out</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>OUT OF TRIM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">endormi</span></i>, the state of a ship when she is not properly balanced
for the purposes of navigation; which is either occasioned by the size,
or position of her masts and sails; or by the comparative quantity, or arrangement
of her cargo and ballast in the hold.</p>

<p class='c008'>OUT-RIGGER, a strong beam of timber, of which there are several fixed
on the side of a ship, and projecting from it, in order to secure the masts in
the act of <i>careening</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>The outer ends of these beams are firmly lashed to a bolt in the ship’s side
beneath, by which they are enabled to support the mast, by counteracting
the strain it suffers from the effort of the careening tackles; which being
applied in the mast-head, draws it downwards, so as to act upon the vessel
with the power of a lever, whose fulcrum is in her centre of gravity.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Out-rigger</span> is also a small boom, occasionally used in the <i>tops</i> to thrust
out the breast-back-stays to windward, in order to increase their tension, and
thereby give additional security to the top-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>This boom is usually furnished with a tackle at its inner-end, communicating
with one of the topmast-shrouds; and has a notch on the outer end
to contain the back-stay, and keep it steddy therein. As soon as the back-stay
is drawn tight, by means of its tackle in the <i>chains</i>, the out-rigger is
applied aloft, which forces it out to windward, beyond the circle of the top,
so as to increase the angle which the mast makes with the back-stay, and
accordingly enable the latter the better to support the former.</p>

<p class='c008'>This machine is sometimes applied without any tackle; it is then thrust
out to its usual distance beyond the top-rim, where it is securely fastened;
after which the back-stay is placed in the notch, and extended below.</p>

<p class='c008'>OWNER, the proprietor of a ship, by whom she is freighted to the
merchant for a sea-voyage.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>P.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>PACKET, or PACKET-BOAT, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paquet</span></i>, Fr.) a vessel appointed by
the government to carry the mail of letters, packets, and expresses from
one kingdom to another by sea, in the most expeditious manner. Thus the
packet-boats, under the direction of the post-master-general of Great-Britain,
carry the mails from Dover to Calais, from Falmouth to Lisbon, from
Harwich to Helvoetsluys, and from Parkgate to Dublin.</p>

<p class='c008'>PADDLE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pagaie</span></i>, (<i><span lang="wel" xml:lang="wel">pattal</span></i>, Welsh) a sort of oar used by the savages of
Africa and America to navigate their canoes. It is much shorter and
broader in the blade than the oars of a boat, and is equally employed in rowing
and steering. See the article <span class='sc'>Canoe</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PAINTER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cableau</span></i>, (probably from <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bindar</span></i>, Sax. to bind) a rope employed
to fasten a boat either along-side of the ship to which she belongs, or
to some wharf, key, &amp;c. as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>PALM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paumet</span></i>, an implement used instead of a thimble in the exercise
of making and mending sails. It is formed of a piece of leather or canvas,
on the middle of which is fixed a round plate of iron, of an inch in diameter,
whose surface is pierced with a number of small holes, to catch the head of
the sail-needle. The leather is formed so as to encircle the hand, and button
on the back thereof, while the iron remains in the palm; so that the
whole strength of the hand may be exerted to thrust the needle through the
canvas, when it is stiff and difficult to be penetrated in sewing.</p>

<p class='c008'>PANCH, a sort of thick and strong mat, or texture, formed by interweaving
twists of rope-yarn as close as possible. It is chiefly used to fasten
on the outside of the yards, or rigging, to prevent their surfaces from being
rubbed by the friction of some other contiguous object, particularly when
the vessel is rocked by a tempestuous sea. See also <span class='sc'>Mat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PARBUCKLE, a contrivance used by sailors to <i>lower</i> a cask or bale
from any height, as the top of a wharf or key, into a boat or lighter, which
lies along-side, being chiefly employed where there is no crane or tackle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is formed by fastening the <i>bight</i> of a rope to a post, or ring, upon the
wharf, and thence passing the two parts of the rope under the two quarters
of the cask, and bringing them back again over it; so that when the two lower
parts remain firmly attached to the post, the two upper parts are gradually
slackened together, and the barrel, or bale, suffered to roll easily downward
to that place where it is received below. This method is also frequently
used by masons, in lifting up or letting down large stones, when they are
employed in building; and from them it has probably been adopted by
seamen.</p>

<p class='c008'>PARCELLING, certain long narrow slips of canvas, daubed with tar,
and frequently bound about a rope, in the same manner as bandages are
applied to a broken limb in surgery.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is chiefly practised when the said rope is intended to be <i>served</i>,
at which time the parcelling is laid in spiral turns, as smoothly upon
the surface as possible, that the rope may not become uneven and full of
ridges. It is also employed to raise the <i>mouses</i>, which are formed on the
<i>stays</i> and on the <i>voyal</i> being firmly fastened by <i>marling</i> it from one end to
the other.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Parcelling</span> a <i>seam</i>, is laying a shred of canvas upon it, and daubing
it over with melted pitch, both above and below the canvas.</p>

<p class='c008'>PARLIAMENT-HEEL, the situation of a ship, when she is made to
stoop a little to one side, so as to clean the upper part of her bottom on
the other side, and cover it with a new composition; and afterwards to perform
the same office on that part of the bottom which was first immersed.
The application of a new composition, or <i>coat</i> of stuff, on this occasion, is
called <i>boot-topping</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>PARREL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">racage</span></i>, (probably from <i>parallel</i>) a machine used to fasten the
sail-yards of a ship to the masts, in such a manner as that they may be
easily hoisted and lowered thereon, as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are four different sorts of parrels, one of which is formed of a
single rope; another, of a rope communicating with an assemblage of <i>ribs</i>
and trucks; a third, of a rope passing through several trucks, without any
<i>ribs</i>; and the fourth, of a <i>truss</i>, by which the yard may be at any time
slackened from the mast, or confined thereto as close as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of these, which is also the simplest, is formed of a piece of rope,
well covered with leather, or spun-yarn, and furnished with an eye at each
end. The middle of it being passed round the middle of the yard, both parts
of it are fastened together on the after-side of the yard, and the two ends,
which are equally long, are passed round the after-part of the mast; and
one of them being brought under, and the other over the yard, the two eyes
are lashed together with a piece of spun-yarn on the fore-side thereof,
whilst another lashing is employed to bind them together, behind the mast,
according to the manner described in the article <span class='sc'>Marling</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second and most complicated are composed of ribs and trucks, the
former of which are long flat pieces of wood, having two holes near their
ends, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bigots</span></i>, as represented by fig. <i>a.</i> plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. the latter, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pommes</span></i>, are
small globular pieces, <i>b</i>, with a hole through the middle, of the same size with
those of the ribs. Between every two ribs are placed two trucks, of which
one is opposite to the upper hole, and the other to the lower holes of both
ribs; so that the parrel-rope, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bâtard</span></i>, which passes through the whole, unites
them together like a string of beads.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to fasten this machine <i>c</i> more conveniently about the mast and
yard, so as to attach the latter to the former, the parrel-rope is formed of
two pieces, each of which are furnished with an eye at one end, and both
eyes lie on one side of the mast; that is to say, one piece of the rope passes
through the lower part of the parrel, and thence under the yard, whilst the
other comes through the upper part of the parrel and over the yard, till
both eyes meet on the fore-side of the yard, where they are <i>joined</i> together.
The other two ends of the parrel-rope are passed about the yard, and the
hind part of the parrel alternately, till the latter is sufficiently secured to the
former. The whole process is compleated by <i>marling</i> the turns of the parrel-rope
together, so as to confine them close in the cavity, formed on the back
of the ribs, as expressed in the figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third is nothing more than a single rope, with any number of trucks
thereon, sufficient to embrace the mast. These are calculated for the cheeks
of a <i>gaff</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last, which are known by the name of truss-parrels, are somewhat
resembling the first, only that instead of being fastened by lashings, the ropes,
of which they are composed, communicate with tackles reaching to the deck,
so that the parrel may be occasionally slackened or straitened, in order to let
the yard move off from the mast, or confine it thereto as strictly as possible.
The last of these are peculiar to the lower-yards, whereon they are extremely
convenient. The second are always used for the top-sail yards, and
frequently for the lower-yards, in merchant-ships; and the first are seldom
employed but for the top-gallant-yards.</p>

<p class='c008'>PARSLING. See <span class='sc'>Parcelling</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PARTING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démarrer</span></i>, the state of being driven from the anchors, expressed
of a ship, when she has broke her cable by the violence of the wind,
waves, or current, or all of them together.</p>

<p class='c008'>PARTNERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etambraies</span></i>, certain pieces of plank nailed round the several
<i>scuttles</i>, or holes, in a ship’s deck, wherein are contained the masts and capsterns.
They are used to strengthen the deck where it is weakened by those
breaches, but particularly to support it when the mast leans against it; as
impressed by a weight of sail, or when the capstern bears forcibly upon it
whilst charged with a great effort.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Partners</span> is also a name given occasionally to the scuttles themselves,
wherein the masts and capsterns are fixed.</p>

<p class='c008'>PASS, or PASSPORT, a permission granted by any state to navigate in
some particular sea, without hindrance or molestation from it. It contains
the name of the vessel, and that of the master, together with her tonnage,
and the number of her crew, certifying that she belongs to the subjects of a
particular state, and requiring all persons, at peace with that state, to suffer
her to proceed on her voyage without interruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>PASSAGE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traversée</span></i>, a voyage from one place to another by sea; an
outward or homeward-bound voyage.</p>

<p class='c008'>PASSAREE, a rope used to fasten the main-tack down to the ship’s side,
a little behind the <i>chesstree</i>. This contrivance however is very rarely used,
and never but in light breezes of wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>PAUL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elinguet</span></i>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">epaule</span></i>, Fr.) a certain short bar of wood, or iron, fixed
close to the <i>capstern</i>, or <i>windlass</i> of a ship, to prevent those engines from rolling
back, or giving way, when they are employed to heave-in the cable, or
otherwise charged with any great effort. See <span class='sc'>Capstern</span> and <span class='sc'>Windlass</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PAUNCH. See <span class='sc'>Panch</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> PAY, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">espalmer</span></i>, as a naval term, implies to daub or anoint the surface
of any body, in order to preserve it from the injuries of the water, weather,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the bottom of a ship is paid with a composition of tallow, sulphur,
resin, &amp;c. as described in the article <span class='sc'>Breaming</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sides of a ship are usually paid with tar, turpentine, or resin; or by a
composition of tar and oil, to which is sometimes added red oker, &amp;c. to
protect the planks thereof from being split by the sun or wind. The lower-masts
are, for the same reasons, paid with materials of the same sort, if we
except those, along which their respective sails are frequently hoisted and
lowered; such are the masts of <i>sloops</i> and <i>schooners</i>, which are always paid
with tallow for this purpose: for the same reason all top-masts and top-gallant-masts
are also paid with hog’s lard, butter, or tallow. See <span class='sc'>Coat</span> and <span class='sc'>Stuff</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PAYING-OFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abattée</span></i>, the movement by which a ship’s head falls to
leeward of the point whither it was previously directed: particularly when,
by neglect of the helmsman, she had inclined to windward of her course, so
as to make the head-sails shiver in the wind, and retard her velocity. See
also <span class='sc'>Falling-off</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Paying-off</span> is likewise used to signify the payment of the ship’s officers
and crew, and the discharge of the ship from service, in order to be laid-up
at the moorings.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Paying-out</span>, or <span class='sc'>Paying-away</span>, the act of slackening a cable, or other
rope, so as to let it run out of the vessel for some particular purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>PEAK, or PEEK, a name given to the upper-corner of all those sails
which are extended by a <i>gaff</i>; or by a yard which crosses the mast obliquely,
as the mizen-yard of a ship, the main-yard of a <i>bilander</i>, &amp;c. The upper
extremity of those yards and gaffs are also denominated the peak. Hence</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peek-haliards</span>, are the ropes, or tackles, by which the outer end of a
gaff is hoisted, as opposed to the <i>throat</i>-haliards, which are applied to the inner
end. See <span class='sc'>Haliards</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PENDANT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flamme</span></i>, a sort of long narrow banner, displayed from the
mast-head of a ship of war, and usually terminating in two ends or points,
as expressed by <i>a</i>, fig. 4. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. There are, besides others, pendants,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cornets</span></i>, of a larger kind, used to distinguish the chief of a squadron of ships.
See the article <span class='sc'>Commodore</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Pendant</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pantoire</span></i>, is also a short piece of rope, fixed under the shrouds,
upon the head of the main-mast and fore-mast, from which it depends as
low as the <i>cat-harpings</i>, having an eye in the lower-end, which is armed with
an iron <i>thimble</i>, to prevent the eye from being fretted by the hooks of the
main and fore-tackles, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are, besides, many other pendants of the latter kind, which are
generally single or double ropes, to whose lower extremities is attached a
block, or tackle: such are the fish-pendant, the yard-tackle-pendants, the
reef-tackle-pendants, &amp;c. all of which are employed to transmit the effort of
their respective tackles to some distant object.</p>

<p class='c008'>PERIAGUA, a sort of large canoe, used in the Leeward islands, South
America, and the gulf of Mexico. It differs from the common vessels of
that name, as being composed of the trunks of two trees, hollowed and
united into one fabric; whereas those which are properly called canoes, are
formed of the body of one tree. See <span class='sc'>Canoe</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PIER, a strong mound, or fence, projecting into the sea, to break off the
violence of the waves from the entrance of a harbour.</p>

<p class='c008'>PILLOW, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coussin</span></i>, a block of timber, whereon the inner-end of the
bowsprit is supported. See <span class='sc'>Bowsprit</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PILOT, the officer who superintends the navigation, either upon the sea-coast
or on the main ocean. It is, however, more particularly applied by our
mariners to the person charged with the direction of a ship’s course, on, or
near the sea-coast, and into the roads, bays, rivers, havens, &amp;c. within his
respective district<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PIN <i>of a block</i>. See <span class='sc'>Block</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PINK, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pinque</span></i>, Fr.) a name given to a ship with a very narrow stern;
whence all vessels, however small, whose sterns are fashioned in this manner,
are called <i>pink-sterned</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PINNACE, a small vessel, navigated with oars and sails, and having
generally two masts, which are rigged like those of a schooner.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Pinnace</span> is also a boat, usually rowed with eight oars. See the article
<span class='sc'>Boat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PINTLES, certain pins or hooks, fastened upon the back part of the
rudder, with their points downwards, in order to enter into, and rest upon
the <i>googings</i>, fixed on the stern-post to hang the rudder. See <span class='sc'>Helm</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PIRATE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pirate</span></i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πειρατης</span>, Gr.) a sea-robber, or an armed ship that roams
the seas without any legal commission, and seizes or plunders every vessel
she meets indiscriminately, whether friends or enemies.</p>

<p class='c008'>The colours usually displayed by pirates are said to be a black field, with a
death’s head, a battle-axe and hour-glass. The last instrument is generally
supposed to determine the time allowed to the prisoners, whom they take,
to consider whether they will join the pirates in their felonious combination,
or be put to death, which is often perpetrated in the most cruel manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst the most celebrated pirates of the north is recorded <i>Alvilda</i>,
daughter of a king of the Goths, named <i>Sypardus</i>. She embraced this occupation
to deliver herself from the violence imposed on her inclination, by a
marriage with <i>Alf</i>, son of <i>Sigarus</i>, king of Denmark. She drest herself as
a man, and composed her band of rowers, and the rest of her crew, of a
number of young women, attired in the same manner. Amongst the first of
her cruizes she touched at a place where a company of pirates bewailed the
death of their captain. The strangers were captivated with the agreeable
manners of Alvilda, and chose her for their chief. By this reinforcement she
became so formidable upon the sea, that prince Alf came to engage her.
She sustained his attacks for a considerable time; but, in a vigorous action,
Alf boarded her vessel, and having killed the greatest part of her crew, seized
the captain, namely, herself; whom nevertheless he knew not, because the
princess had a casque which covered her visage. Being master of her person,
he removed the casque, and, in spite of her disguise, instantly recognized
her, and offered her his hand in wedlock<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PITCH, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brai</span></i>, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pix</span></i>, Lat.) a composition, black, dry, brittle, and shining,
which remains at the bottom of an alembic after the oil of turpentine is
drawn off by distillation. It is used in calking a ship, to fill the chinks, or
intervals between the planks of her sides, or decks, or bottom. It is sometimes
mixed with resin, or other glutinous material. See <span class='sc'>Tar</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Pitch</span> <i>the seams</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Pay</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PITCHING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tangage</span></i>, (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">appicciare</span></i>, Ital.) may be defined, the vertical vibration
which the length of a ship makes about her centre of gravity; or
the movement, by which she plunges her <i>head</i> and after-part alternately
into the hollow of the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>This motion may proceed from two causes: the waves, which agitate the
vessel; and the wind upon the sails, which makes her stoop to every blast
thereof. The first absolutely depends upon the agitation of the sea, and is
not susceptible of inquiry; and the second is occasioned by the inclination
of the masts, and may be submitted to certain established maxims<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the wind acts upon the sails, the mast yields to its effort, with an
inclination, which increases in proportion to the length of the mast, to the
augmentation of the wind, and to the comparative weight and distribution
of the ship’s lading.</p>

<p class='c008'>The repulsion of the water, to the effort of gravity, opposes itself to this
inclination, or at least sustains it, by as much as the repulsion exceeds
the momentum, or absolute effort of the mast, upon which the wind
operates. At the end of each blast, when the wind suspends its action,
this repulsion lifts the vessel; and these successive inclinations and repulsions
produce the movement of <i>pitching</i>, which is very inconvenient; and when
it is considerable, will greatly retard the course, as well as endanger the mast,
and strain the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>PLANE, a term used by shipwrights, implying the area, or imaginary
surface, contained within any particular outlines. Thus the plane of elevation,
plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. exhibits a surface limited by the head before, by the stern
abaft, by the keel below, and by the upper part of the vessel’s side above.
Thus the horizontal plane, in the same plate, is comprehended within the
lines which describe the ship’s greatest breadth and length; and thus also the
plane of projection, represented likewise in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. circumscribes the greatest
height and breadth of the same vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>PLANKING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">border</span></i>, the act of covering and lining the sides of a ship with an
assemblage of oak planks, which completes the process of ship-building, and
is sometimes called <i>laying on the skin</i>, by the artificers. See the article <span class='sc'>Building</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The breadth and thickness of all the planks of a 74 gun ship, as also of
her <i>wales</i> and <i>thick-stuff</i>, are exhibited in the midship section, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PLAT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garcette de cable</span></i>, a sort of braided cordage, formed of several
<i>strands</i> of old rope-yarn, twilled into <i>foxes</i>. It is used to wind about that
part of the cable which lies in the <i>hause-hole</i>, or against the fore-part of the
ship, where it would otherwise be greatly injured by the continual friction,
produced by the agitation of the ship in stormy weather. See the articles
<span class='sc'>Freshen</span> and <span class='sc'>Service</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PLUG, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pelardeaux</span></i>, (<i><span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">plugg</span></i>, Swed.) certain pieces of timber, formed like
the frustrum of a cone, and used to stop the hause-holes, and the breaches
made in the body of a ship by cannon-balls; the former of which are called
hause-plugs, and the latter, shot-plugs, which are formed of various sizes in
proportion to the holes made by the different sizes of shot, which may penetrate
the ship´s sides or bottom in battle; accordingly they are always ready
for this purpose. See <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PLUNDER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">butin</span></i>, a name given to the effects of the officers or crew of
a prize, which are pillaged by the captors.</p>

<p class='c008'>PLYING, the act of making, or endeavouring to make, a progress against
the direction of the wind. Hence a ship, that advances well in her course
in this manner of sailing, is said to be a good plyer, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulinier</span></i>. See the articles
<span class='sc'>Beating</span> and <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>POINT, a low angle, or arm of the shore, which projects into the sea, or
into a river, beyond the rest of the beach.</p>

<p class='c008'>POINTING, the operation of tapering the end of a rope, and weaving a
sort of mat, or close texture, about the diminished part of it, so as to thrust
it more easily through any hole, and prevent it from being readily untwisted.
Thus the end of a <i>reef-line</i> is pointed, so that, being stiffer, it may more
readily penetrate the eye-let holes of the reef; and the ends of the strands of
a cable are occasionally pointed, for the greater conveniency of <i>splicing</i> it
to another cable, especially when this task is frequently performed. The
extremities of the splice of a cable are also pointed, that it may pass with
more facility through the hause-holes.</p>

<p class='c008'>POINTS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garcettes de ris</span></i>, short flat pieces of braided cordage, tapering
from the middle towards each end, and used to reef the courses and top-sails
of a ship. See the article <span class='sc'>Reef</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>POLACRE, a ship with three masts, usually navigated in the Levant, and
other parts of the Mediterranean. These vessels are generally furnished with
square sails upon the main-mast, and <i>lateen</i> sails upon the fore-mast and
mizen-mast. Some of them however carry square sails upon all the three
masts, particularly those of Provence in France. Each of their masts is
commonly formed of one piece, so that they have neither top-mast nor top-gallant-mast;
neither have they any <i>horses</i> to their yards, because the men
stand upon the top-sail-yard to loose or furl the top-gallant-sail, and on the
lower-yard to <i>reef</i>, loose, or furl the top-sail, whose yard is lowered sufficiently
down for that purpose. See also <span class='sc'>Xebec</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>POLE-AXE, a sort of hatchet nearly resembling a battle-axe, having an
handle about 15 inches in length, and being furnished with a sharp point,
or claw, bending downwards from the back of its head; the blade whereof
is formed like that of any other hatchet. It is principally employed to cut
away and destroy the rigging of any adversary who endeavours to board.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pole-axes are also said to have been successfully used on some occasions
in boarding an enemy, whose sides were above those of the boarder.
This is executed by detaching several gangs to enter at different parts of the
ship’s length, at which time the pole-axes are forcibly driven into her side,
one above another, so as to form a sort of scaling-ladders.</p>

<p class='c008'>POLE-MAST. See the article <span class='sc'>Mast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Under bare</i> <span class='sc'>Poles</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etre à sec</span></i>, the situation of a ship at sea when all her sails are
furled, particularly in a tempest. See the articles <span class='sc'>Scudding</span> and <span class='sc'>Trying</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>POMIGLION, a name given by seamen to the cascabel, or hindmost
knob of a cannon. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>PONTOON, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ponton</span></i>, Fr.) a low flat vessel, nearly resembling a lighter,
or barge of burthen, and furnished with cranes, <i>capsterns</i>, tackles, and
other machinery necessary for careening ships of all sizes. These are very
common in the principal parts of the Mediterranean, but are rarely used in
the northern parts of Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>POOP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dunette</span></i>, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puppis</span></i>, Lat.) the highest and aftmost deck of a ship.
See the article <span class='sc'>Deck</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Poop-royal</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dunette sur dunette</span></i>, a short deck, or platform, placed over
the aftmost part of the poop in the largest of the French and Spanish men
of war, and serving as a cabin for their masters and pilots. This is usually
called the top-gallant-poop by our shipwrights.</p>

<p class='c008'>POOPING, the shock of a high and heavy sea, upon the stern or quarter
of a ship, when she <i>scuds</i> before the wind in a tempest. This circumstance
is extremely dangerous to the vessel, which is thereby exposed to the risk of
having her whole stern beat inwards, by which she would be immediately laid
open to the entrance of the sea, and of course, foundered or torn to pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>PORT, a harbour or haven on the sea-coast. See the article <span class='sc'>Harbour</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Port</span> is also a name given, on some occasions, to the larboard, or left-side
of the ship, as in the following instances:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The ship heels to</i> <span class='sc'>Port</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> stoops or inclines to the larboard side.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Top the yard to</i> <span class='sc'>Port</span>, the order to make the larboard extremity of a
yard higher than the other. See <span class='sc'>Topping</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Port</span> <i>the helm</i>! the order to put the helm over to the larboard-side of the
vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all these senses this phrase appears intended to prevent any mistakes
happening from the similarity of sounds in the words starboard and larboard,
particularly when they relate to the helm, where a misapprehension might
be attended with very dangerous consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'>PORTS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabords</span></i>, the embrasures or openings in the side of a ship of war,
wherein the artillery is ranged in battery upon the decks above and below.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ports are formed of a sufficient extent to point and fire the cannon,
without injuring the ship’s side by the recoil; and as it serves no end to
enlarge them beyond what is necessary for that purpose, the shipwrights
have established certain dimensions, by which they are cut in proportion to
the size of the cannon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ports are shut in at sea by a sort of hanging-doors, called the <i>port-lids</i>,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mantelets</span></i>; which are fastened by hinges to their upper-edges, so as to let
down when the cannon are drawn into the ship. By this means the water
is prevented from entering the lower-decks in a turbulent sea. The lower
and upper edges of the ports are always parallel to the deck, so that the guns,
when levelled in their carriages, are all equally high above the lower extremity
of the ports which is called the port-cells. The ports are exhibited,
throughout the ship’s whole length, by H. in the <span class='sc'>Elevation</span>, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.
They are also represented upon a larger scale in plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. fig. 10. and plate
<a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. fig. 3. The gun-room-ports, in the ship’s counter, are expressed by
H. fig. 1. plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. See also the articles <span class='sc'>Deck</span> and <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>POWDER-CHESTS, certain small boxes, charged with powder and
a quantity of old nails, or splinters of iron, and fastened occasionally on the
decks and sides of a ship, in order to be discharged on an enemy who
attempts to seize her by boarding. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>These cases are usually from 12 to 18 inches in length, and about 8 or
10 in breadth, having their outer or upper-part terminating in an edge.
They are nailed to several places of the <i>quarter</i>, the quarter-deck and bulk-head
of the waist, having a train of powder which communicates with the
inner apartments of the ship, so as to be fired at pleasure to annoy the
enemy. They are particularly used in merchant-ships, which are furnished
with close quarters to oppose the boarders. See <span class='sc'>Close-Quarters</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PRAM, or PRAME, a sort of lighter, used in Holland and the ports
of the Baltic sea, to carry the cargo of a merchant-ship <i>along-side</i>, in order
to lade her: or to bring it ashore to be lodged in the store-houses after being
discharged out of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>PRATIC, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pratique</span></i>, a term used in the European ports of the Mediterranean
sea, implying free intercourse or communication with the natives of
the country, after a limited quarantine has been performed, in consequence of
a voyage to Barbary or Turkey.</p>

<p class='c008'>PREVENTER, an additional rope, employed at times to support any
other, when the latter suffers an unusual strain, particularly in a strong gale
of wind; as the</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Preventer-brace</span>, a temporary brace, fixed occasionally to succour the
main or fore-yard of a ship, but particularly the latter, when it is charged
with a greater effort than usual, and which, it is apprehended, the common
standing braces would not be able to support. See <span class='sc'>Brace</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Preventer-shrouds</i>, and <i>Preventer-stays</i>, are applied, in the same
manner, to serve the same purposes; and may be easily understood by referring
to the articles <span class='sc'>Shroud</span> and <span class='sc'>Stay</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PRICKING <i>the chart</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pointer</span></i>, the act of tracing a ship’s course upon a
a marine chart, by the help of a scale and compasses, so as to discover her
present situation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Pricking</span> <i>the sails</i>, the act of stitching two cloths of a sail together
along the space, comprehended between the two edges, or selvages, that
overlay each other. Or, it is the sowing a middle-seam between the two
seams which are employed to unite every cloth of a sail to the next adjoining.
This operation is rarely performed till the sails have been worn
for a considerable time, so that the twine, with which they were originally
sewed, is become very feeble and incapable of resisting the efforts of a strong
gale of wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>PRIMING, the train of powder which is laid from the opening of the
touch-hole, along the cavity of the pan, in order to fire the piece: also the
operation of laying this train. See the articles <span class='sc'>Cannon</span> and <span class='sc'>Exercise</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PRIMING-WIRE, or PRIMING-IRON, a sort of iron-needle, employed
to penetrate the touch-hole of a cannon, when it is loaded, in order to discover
whether the powder contained therein is thoroughly dry, and fit for
immediate service.</p>

<p class='c008'>PRIVATEER, a vessel of war, armed and equipped by particular merchants,
and furnished with a military commission by the admiralty, or the
officers who superintend the marine department of a country, to cruize
against the enemy, and take, sink, or burn their shipping, or otherwise
annoy them as opportunity offers. These vessels are generally governed on
the same plan with his majesty’s ships, although they are guilty of many
scandalous depredations, which are very rarely practised by the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>PRIZE, a vessel taken from the enemy by a ship of war, privateer, or
armed merchantman<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PRIZING, the application of a lever to move any weighty body, as a
cask, anchor, cannon, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>PROTEST, an instrument, drawn up in writing, and attested before a
justice of peace, by the master and a part of the ship’s crew after the expiration
of a voyage, describing the severity of the said voyage, occasioned
by tempestuous weather, heavy seas, an insufficient crew, or any other
circumstances by which the ship has suffered, or may suffer, either in her
hull, masts, rigging, or cargo. It is chiefly intended to shew, that such
damages or misfortunes did not happen through any neglect or ill conduct of
the master or his officers.</p>

<p class='c008'>PROW, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">proue</span></i> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pros</span></i>, Lat.) a name given by seamen to the beak, or
pointed cut-water of a polacre, xebeck, or galley. The upper-part of the
prow, in those vessels, is usually furnished with a grating-platform for the
convenience of the seamen who walk out to perform whatever is necessary
about the sails or rigging on the bowsprit.</p>

<p class='c008'>PUDDENING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourrelet</span></i>, a thick wreath, or circle of cordage, tapering
from the middle towards the ends, and fastened about the main-mast and
fore-mast of a ship, to prevent their yards from falling down, when the
ropes by which they are usually suspended are shot away in battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The puddening, which is represented by fig. 1. plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. is generally
formed in the following manner: A small piece of rope, whose length is
twice the diameter of the mast, is spliced together at the two ends, and
being thus doubled and extended, a <i>thimble</i> is seized into each of the extremities.
After this a large quantity of parcelling is firmly wound about
its surface in such a manner as to make it gradually larger from the two
ends towards the middle. It is afterwards, once or twice, <i>served</i> with
spun-yarn throughout its whole length, to bind the parcelling more closely,
and render it firmer and more compact; and the whole is completed by
<i>pointing</i> it on the surface. Being then fitted with a laniard at one of the
eyes, it is fixed about the mast by passing the laniard alternately through
both eyes or thimbles on the fore side of the mast. See also <span class='sc'>Dolphin</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>PULLING, a name given by sailors to the act of rowing with the oars.</p>

<p class='c008'>PUMP, a well-known machine, used to discharge the water from the
ship’s bottom into the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common pump is so generally understood, that it hardly requires any
description. It is a long wooden tube, whose lower end rests upon the ship’s
bottom, between the timbers, in an apartment called the <i>well</i>, inclosed for
this purpose near the middle of the ship’s length.</p>

<p class='c008'>This pump is managed by means of the brake, and the two boxes, or
pistons. Near the middle of the tube, in the chamber of the pump, is
fixed the lower-box, which is furnished with a staple, by which it may at
any time be hooked and drawn up, in order to examine it. To the upper-box
is fixed a long bar of iron, called the spear, whose upper-end is fastened
to the end of the brake, by means of an iron bolt passing through both.
At a small distance from this bolt the brake is confined by another bolt
between two cheeks, or ears, fixed perpendicularly on the top of the pump.
Thus the brake acts upon the spear as a lever, whose fulcrum is the bolt
between the two cheeks, and discharges the water by means of the valves,
or clappers, fixed on the upper and lower boxes.</p>

<p class='c008'>These sort of pumps, however, are very rarely used in ships of war, unless
of the smallest size. The most useful machine of this kind, in large ships,
is the chain-pump, which is universally used in the navy. This is no other
than a long chain, equipped with a sufficient number of valves, at proper
distances, which passes downward through a wooden tube, and returns upward
in the same manner on the other side. It is managed by a <i>roller</i> or
<i>winch</i>, whereon several men may be employed at once; and thus it discharges,
in a limited time, a much greater quantity of water than the common pump,
and that with less fatigue and inconvenience to the labourers.</p>

<p class='c008'>This machine is nevertheless exposed to several disagreable accidents
by the nature of its construction. The chain is of too complicated a fabric,
and the sprocket-wheels employed to wind it up from the ship’s
bottom, are deficient in a very material circumstance, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> some contrivance
to prevent the chain from sliding or jerking back upon the surface of the
wheel, which frequently happens when the valves are charged with a considerable
weight of water, or when the pump is violently worked. The
links are evidently too short, and the immechanical manner in which they
are connected, exposes them to a great friction in passing round the wheels.
Hence they are sometimes apt to break or burst asunder in very dangerous
situations, when it is extremely difficult or impracticable to repair the
chain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The consideration of the known inconveniences of the above machine
has given rise to the invention of several others which should better answer
the purpose. They have been offered to the public one after another with
pompous recommendations by their respective projectors, who have never
failed to report their effects as considerably superior to that of the chain-pump
with which they have been tried. It is however much to be lamented,
that in these sort of trials there is not always a scrupulous attention
to what may be called mechanical justice. The artist who wishes to introduce
a new piece of mechanism, has generally sufficient address to compare
its effects with one of the former machines which is crazy or out of repair.
A report of this kind indeed favours strongly of the evidence of a false
witness, but this finesse is not always discovered. The persons appointed to
superintend the comparative effects of the different pumps, have not always
a competent knowledge of hydraulics to detect these artifices, or to remark
with precision the defects and advantages of those machines as opposed
to each other. Thus the several inventions proposed to supplant the
chain-pump have hitherto proved ineffectual, and are now no longer remembered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of late, however, some considerable improvements have been made on the
naval chain-pump, by Mr. Cole, under the direction of Capt. Bentinck.
The chain of this machine is more simple and mechanical, and much less
exposed to damage. It is exactly similar to that of the fire engine, and appears
to have been first applied to the pump by Mr. Mylne, to exhaust
the water from the caissons at Black-fryars bridge. It has thence been
transferred to the marine by Capt. Bentinck, after having received some material
additions to answer that service. The principal superiority of this
pump to the former is, 1. That the chain is more simple and more easily
worked, and of course less exposed to injuries by friction. 2. That the chain
is secured upon the wheel, and thereby prevented from jerking back when
charged with a column of water. 3. That it may be easily taken up and
repaired when broken, or choaked with ballast, &amp;c. 4. That it discharges
a much greater quantity of water with an inferior number of men.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>Q.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>QUADRANT, an instrument used to take the altitude of the sun or
stars at sea, in order to determine the latitude of the place; or the sun’s
azimuth, so as to ascertain the magnetical variation.</p>

<p class='c008'>These instruments are variously constructed, and by consequence the apparatus
of each kind is somewhat different from those of the others, according
to the improvements they have at different times received from several
ingenious artists.</p>

<p class='c008'>As all the different kinds of quadrants are circumstantially described,
either in printed directions to use them, or in other books, a particular
account of them here might reasonably be esteemed superfluous. It suffices
to say that the most useful, as well as the most general, for taking observations
at sea is the octant, originally invented by Sir Isaac Newton, and since
that time improved and brought into practice by Mess. Godfrey and Hadley.
It may not however be unnecessary to remark, that the back-observation,
which, in many situations, is certainly more accurate and useful than that
which is taken in front, is almost totally neglected by our observers, under
pretence of its being more uncertain, or more liable to error: but really
because it is somewhat more difficult to learn. We may venture to affirm
however, that no artist, who thoroughly understands the operation, will ever
advance so absurd an objection, unless we should doubt the testimony of a
multitude of experiments.</p>

<p class='c008'>QUARANTINE, the state of the persons who are restrained within the
limits of a ship, or lazaretto; or otherwise prevented from having a free
communication with the inhabitants of any country, till the expiration of an
appointed time, during which they are repeatedly examined with regard to
their health. It is chiefly intended to prevent the importation of the plague,
from the countries under the dominion of the Turks.</p>

<p class='c008'>QUARTER <i>of a ship</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hanche</span></i>, that part of a ship’s side which lies towards
the stern, or which is comprehended between the aftmost end of the
main <i>chains</i> and the sides of the stern, where it is terminated by the quarter-pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the lines by which the quarter and bow of a ship, with respect
to her length, are only imaginary, yet experience appears sufficiently to
have ascertained their limits: so that if we were to divide the ship’s sides
into five equal portions, the names of each space would be readily enough
expressed. Thus the first, from the stern, would be the quarter; the second,
abaft the midships; the third, the midships; the fourth, before the midships;
and the fifth, the bow. Whether these divisions, which in reality are somewhat
arbitrary, are altogether improper, may be readily discovered by referring
to the mutual situation or approach of two adjacent vessels. The
enemy boarded us on the larboard-side! Whereabouts? Abaft the midships,
before the midships, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the marks, by which vessels of different constructions are distinguished
from each other, are generally more conspicuous on the stern, or quarter,
than any other part, we have represented, in plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. some of the quarters,
which assume the most different shapes, and form the greatest contrast
with each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 6. the quarter of a Dutch dogger, or galliot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 7. represents the stern and quarter of a sloop of war.</p>

<p class='c008'>The quarters of all other ships have a near affinity to those above exhibited.
Thus all ships of the line, and East-Indiamen, are formed with a
quarter little differing from the principal figure in this plate. Xebecs have
quarters nearly resembling those of galeasses, only somewhat higher. Hag-boats
and pinks approach the figure of <i>cats</i>, the former being a little broader
in the stern, and the latter a little narrower; and the sterns and quarters of
cats seem to be derived from those of fly-boats. The sterns of Dutch
doggers and galliots are indeed singular, and like those of no other modern
vessel: they have nevertheless a great resemblance to the ships of the antient
Grecians, as represented in medals and other monuments of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>On the</i> <span class='sc'>Quarter</span>, may be defined an arch of the horizon, contained between
the line prolonged from the ship’s stern and any distant object, as land, ships,
&amp;c. Thus if the ship’s keel lies on an east and west line, the stern being
westward, any distant object perceived in the north-west or south-west, is
said to be on the larboard or starboard quarter. See the article <span class='sc'>Bearing</span>.</p>

a number of planks, which are to be securely fastened therein. The depth
of this channel is equal to the thickness of the plank, so that when the end
of the latter is let into the rabbit, it will be level with the outside of the

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> RAISE, to elevate any distant object at sea, by a gradual approach
towards it from the place whence it was formerly observed. This effect is
known to be occasioned by the convexity of the surface of the sea, which
previously intercepted the view, when directed towards the lower parts of the
said object. This term is opposed to <span class='sc'>Laying</span>, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>RAISING <i>a purchase</i>, the act of disposing certain instruments, or machines,

<p class='c008'>RAKE, the projection of the upper parts of a ship at the height of the

<p class='c008'>RAKING <i>a ship</i>, the act of cannonading a ship on the stern, or head, so
as that the balls shall scour the whole length of her decks; which is one of
the most dangerous incidents that can happen in a naval action. This is
frequently called raking fore and aft, being the same with what is called
<i>enfilading</i> by engineers.</p>

<p class='c008'>RANGE, a sufficient length of the cable, drawn up on the deck, before
the anchor is cast loose from the bow, to let it sink to the bottom, without
being interrupted, that the flukes may be forced the deeper into the ground,
by the additional weight which the anchor acquires in sinking. For this
reason the range, which is drawn up out of the tier, ought to be equal in
length, to the depth of the water where the ship anchors. See <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>
and <span class='sc'>Cable-Tier</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Range</span>, is also the distance to which a bomb or cannon-ball is thrown from a
piece of artillery, by the explosion of gun-powder. See the articles <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>
and <span class='sc'>Mortar</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flight of a shot is distinguished, by artillery people, into two different
ranges, of which the first is called the point-blank; and the second, the
random-shot. To these also may be added the <i>ricochet</i>, or rolling and
bounding-shot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever has been observed, in other parts of this work, with regard to
the flight of a shot from a piece of artillery, is on the presumption that it
describes a right line in its passage to the object. This, however, is not
strictly true; because by its weight it inclines to the earth every instant of its
motion: but as its velocity is very great when first discharged from the cannon,
the weight does not sensibly affect the direction in the first instant
of its motion. Thus the line it describes, as represented in plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. extending
from fig. 16. to the ship under sail, is apparently straight, and the extent
of this line is called the <i>point-blank</i> range of the piece; which accordingly
may be defined the extent of the apparent right line, described by a ball
discharged from a cannon.</p>

<p class='c008'>This range is much less than the greatest range, or <i>random-shot</i>; but the
piece cannot be levelled, or, as it is generally expressed, <i>pointed</i> at an object
intended to be battered, if that object is not within the distance of the point-blank
range; for beyond that, the stroke is very uncertain.</p>

<p class='c008'>A piece is said to fire at random-shot, when the breech rests upon the bed
of the carriage, so that the ball is carried to the greatest possible distance.
But as, in this method of firing, the ball cannot be directed to any determinate
object, it is rarely used in the sea-service, and only when the shot cannot fail
of doing great execution in the place whereon it falls.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the two ranges above described, there is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ricochet</span></i><a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a>, invented
by the Marshal de Vauban.</p>

<p class='c008'>To fire a piece by way of the ricochet, the cannon is only charged with
a quantity of powder sufficient to carry the shot along the face of the works
attacked. The shot, thus discharged, goes rolling and bounding, killing,
maiming, or destroying all it meets in its course, and creates much more
disorder by going thus slowly, than if thrown from the piece with greater
violence.</p>

<p class='c008'>When ricochet firing is used, the pieces are elevated from 3 to 6 degrees,
and no more; because if the elevation is greater, the shot will only drop
into the work, without bounding from one place to another. They are to
be loaded with a small charge, and directed in such a manner as just to go
over the parapet<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the opinion of engineers formerly, that by charging the pieces
high, the ball was thrown to a greater distance. Hence the pieces were
charged with two thirds, or even the whole weight of the shot, in order to
impel it with greater velocity; but it has been discovered since, that the
half, or one third of the weight of the ball, is the fittest charge for the
piece<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the whole quantity of powder, employed to charge the cannon, could
take fire at the same instant, it is apparent that the velocity, communicated
to the shot, would increase in proportion to the additional quantity of powder.
But though the time of its inflammation is very short, it may yet be conceived
as divided into many instants. In the first instant, the powder begins
to dilate and impel the shot forward; and if it has force enough to expel
it from the piece before the whole charge is inflamed, that part which is
left to take fire afterwards will produce no effect at all on the shot. A
charge of extraordinary force does not therefore accelerate the velocity of
the bullet: and hence it follows that the piece ought to be charged with no
more powder, than will take fire whilst the ball is passing through the chace
of the cannon.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may not be amiss to observe here, that the range of cannon is greater
in the morning and at night, than at noon; and in cold, than in<a id='it'></a> hot weather.
The reason is, that at these times the air being less heated, gives less way to
the dilatation of the powder, which being by this means confined, as it were,
to a smaller sphere of action, must have a stronger effect in proportion<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the lengths of cannon are proportional to the height of the charge,
the shot will be discharged with the same velocity, whatever the calibre may
be; and since the ratios of the velocities of shots, issuing from pieces of different
lengths, loaded with different charges of powder, will be of great use in
the construction of cannon, we have collected them in the following table,
where the numbers at the top express the length of the pieces by the diameter
of their shots. That is, the first is 12 diameters; the second 15, and so
on. The first perpendicular column expresses the charges, in respect to the
weight of the shots: thus, ¼, ⅓, ½, ⅔ imply that the weight of the charge
is ¼, ⅓, ½, ⅔ of the weight of the shot. The other numbers, in the same
horizontal lines, express the distance in feet moved over by the velocities of
the shot, uniformly continued in a second of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We made use of the diameter of a 9 pound shot, which being 4 inches,
is more convenient in the calculation; and this diameter expresses the height
of the charge when it is a quarter of the weight of the shot, and the rest in
proportion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Several remarks may be made upon this table, which are of great importance
in the construction of cannon. First, when the charge is but a
quarter of the shot’s weight, the difference between the velocities, when the
length is 12 and 15 diameters, is but 9 feet in a second; and the differences
between the other velocities decrease as the length increases.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hence, as the difference between the velocities when the piece is 15 and
36 diameters long, is but 22 feet in a second, it is easily perceived, that when
the pieces are charged with one quarter of the shot’s weight, the length from
12 to 15 diameters is the best.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Secondly, When the charge is one third of the shot’s weight, the difference
of the velocities, when the piece is 12, 15, and 18 diameters long, are 14, 10
seconds; and from thence decrease more and more, as the length of the
piece increases: so the length, from 15 to 18 diameters seems to be the
best, every thing being considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thirdly, and lastly, it appears, from the same manner of reasoning, that
when the charge is one-half of the shot’s weight, the length ought to be
from 18 to 21 diameters; and when the charge is two thirds of the shot’s
weight, the length ought to be from 21 to 24 diameters.” <cite>Muller’s Artillery.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>As one of the effects of the bomb results from its weight, the range of
mortars is extremely different from that of cannon, because the former is not
pointed at a certain object, like the latter, but inclined to the horizon at a
certain angle; so that the bomb, being thrown up obliquely, much in the
same direction as a tennis-ball struck by the racket, may fall upon the
place intended. Hence it appears that the mortar has no point-blank range,
or at least that no use is made of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mortar, being fixed in a situation obliquely with the horizon, so as
that the line <i>a c</i>, which passes through the middle of it longitudinally, being
continued, would make an angle <i>b a d</i> with the horizon <i>a b</i>; a bomb, discharged
in the direction of this continued line, would deviate from it every
instant of its motion by its weight, which inclines it downwards, and by this
means it would describe a curve-line, as <i>a e b</i>, called a <i>parabola</i><a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The line <i>a b</i>, fig. 19. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. is called the extent of the range, or the
amplitude of the parabola; and the line <i>a d</i>, the elevation of the mortar.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make a bomb fall on a given place, two things are to be considered;
viz. the elevation of the mortar; and the quantity of powder used to charge
it; both of which may be ascertained as follows: A bomb discharged from
a mortar, pointed vertically, will describe a line nearly perpendicular to the
horizon: I say nearly, because the mortar will always have some little motion,
which will destroy the exact perpendicularity of the bomb’s flight; but
abstracted from this, a bomb, discharged vertically, would fall again into
the mortar<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the mortar be afterwards inclined more and more towards the horizon,
the bomb will fall still farther and farther distant from the mortar, till the
elevation rests at 45°; and the more the mortar is pointed under this angle,
the more will the range of the bomb be diminished: all of which is strictly
demonstrated by geometry. But the following is a very simple manner of
conceiving it, without having recourse to that science.</p>

<p class='c008'>A bomb, discharged in the direction of a line, nearly perpendicular to the
horizon, will fall at a little distance from the bomb-vessel. This requires no
proof. A bomb, thrown according to a line that makes a very acute angle
with the horizon, will presently come to the ground by its weight, and by
consequence will not, any more than the other, fall at a considerable distance
from the mortar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence it is easy to conceive, that in order to fall at the greatest distance
from the mortar, the bomb must be fired according to an elevation at the
greatest possible distance, as well from a vertical, as from an horizontal line.
This elevation divides in two equal parts the angle formed by the vertical and
horizontal lines, which being of 90 degrees, or what is called a right angle,
a bomb will be thrown to the greatest distance, in the direction of a line
making an angle of 45 degrees. For above this angle the range will diminish,
because the bomb approaches the vertical line; and under the same
elevation it will also decrease, because the flight of the bomb approaches the
horizontal line.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence also it appears that there are two angles, according to which a
mortar may be inclined to make the bomb fall on the same place; these are
the angles, equally distant from the line, which cuts the quadrant into two
equal parts: so that if, for example, a mortar is elevated at 30°, the bomb
will fall at the same distance as if it had been elevated at 60°, each of these
angles being 15° distant on this, and that side of the quadrant; that is, from
the angle of 45 degrees.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second thing to be considered, is, to know the exact charge of powder
necessary to throw a bomb to a given distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the bomb, being fired at an elevation of 45°, falls short of the place
intended, the charge of powder must be increased. If it reaches the place, or
goes beyond it, it is evident that the charge is sufficient. If the bomb, at
an elevation under 45°, fall short of the place intended, with a given charge,
the mortar must be more elevated: if, on the contrary, it falls too far off,
it must be more inclined to the horizon: and by these essays the proper degree
of inclination may be easily and speedily discovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the mortar then is raised above 45°, it must be more inclined, so as
to make a more acute angle with the horizon, to increase the range of the
bomb; and, on the contrary, raised nearer a perpendicular, to diminish it:
all of which are consequences drawn from what has been said on this subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be observed, first, that the greatest distance to which a bomb can
be thrown, with the strongest charge, is little more than about 1800, or 2000
fathoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Secondly, that though a mortar may be elevated indifferently, either so
much above or below 45° as to carry a bomb to a given distance, yet when
any building is to be destroyed, it should be raised above 45°, because the
shell, rising to a greater height when fired according to a greater angle, falls
with greater force, and by consequence will do more damage to the place
on which it is thrown. But when the business is to fire on a body of men,
the mortar must be pointed below 45°, that the bomb may not have force
enough to enter far into the ground, and that the splinters in the explosion
may do more execution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Example. Knowing the range of a shell at 45 to be 890 yards, required
the range at 30 with the same powder; say, as 100 : 86 : : 890 : 765.4;
and if you have a shell’s range at 30, and would know how far it will go at
45 with the same quantity of powder, rule as 86 : 100 : : 765.4 : 890.</p>

<p class='c008'>N. B. These propositions only hold good when the powder is equal.</p>

<p class='c008'>RATES, the orders or classes into which the ships of war are divided,
according to their force and magnitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been observed, in the article <span class='sc'>Navy</span>, that this regulation,
which limits the rates of men of war to the smallest number possible, seems
to have been dictated by considerations of political œconomy, or of that of the
simplicity of the service in the royal <i>dock-yards</i>. The British fleet is accordingly
distributed into six rates, exclusive of the inferior vessels that usually
attend on naval armaments; as sloops of war, armed ships, bomb-ketches,
fire-ships and cutters, or schooners commanded by lieutenants.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ships of the first rate mount 100 cannon, having 42 pounders on the
lower deck, 24 pounders on the middle deck, 12 pounders on the upper
deck, and 6 pounders on the quarter deck and forecastle. They are manned
with 850 men, including their officers, seamen, marines, and servants.</p>

<p class='c008'>In general, the ships of every rate, besides the captain, have the master,
the boatswain, the gunner, the chaplain, the purser, the surgeon, and the
carpenter; all of whom, except the chaplain, have their mates or assistants,
in which are comprehended the sail-maker, the master at arms, the armorer,
the captain’s clerk, the gunsmith, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of other officers are always in proportion to the rate of the
ship. Thus a first rate has six lieutenants, six master’s mates, twenty-four
midshipmen, and five surgeon’s mates, who are considered as gentlemen;
besides the following petty officers: quarter-masters, and their mates, fourteen;
boatswains mates and yeomen, eight; gunners mates and assistants, six;
quarter-gunners, twenty-five; carpenters mates, two, besides fourteen assistants;
with one steward, and steward’s mate to the purser.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the dimensions of all ships of the same rate were equal, it would be the
simplest and most perspicuous method to collect them into one point of view
in a table; but as there is no invariable rule for the general dimensions, it
must suffice to remark those of some particular ships in each rate; for which
purpose we have selected some of the latest construction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Victory, which is the last built of our first rates, is 222 feet 6
inches in length, from the head to the stern; the length of her keel, 151
feet 3 inches; that of her gun-deck, or lower deck, 186 feet; her extreme
breadth is 51 feet 10 inches; her depth in the <i>hold</i>, 21 feet 6 inches; her
burthen 2162 tons; and her poop reaches 6 feet before the mizen-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ships of the second rate carry 90 guns upon three decks, of which those
on the lower battery are 32 pounders; those on the middle, 18 pounders;
on the upper-deck, 12 pounders; and those on the quarter-deck, 6 pounders,
which usually amount to four or six. Their complement of men is 750,
in which there are six lieutenants, four master’s mates, twenty-four midshipmen,
and four surgeon’s mates, fourteen quarter-masters and their mates,
eight boatswain’s mates and yeomen, six gunner’s mates and yeomen, with
twenty-two quarter-gunners, two carpenter’s mates, with ten assistants, and
one steward and steward’s mate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ships of the third rate carry from 64 to 80 cannon, which are 32, 18, and
9 pounders. The 80–gun ships however begin to grow out of repute, and
to give way to those of 74, 70, &amp;c. which have only two whole batteries;
whereas the former have three, with 28 guns planted on each, the cannon
of their upper-deck being the same as those on the quarter-deck and fore-castle
of the latter, which are 9 pounders. The complement in a 74 is 650,
and in a 64, 500 men; having, in peace, 4 lieutenants, but in war, 5;
and when an admiral is aboard, 6. They have 3 master’s mates, 16 midshipmen,
3 surgeon’s mates, 10 quarter-masters and their mates, 6 boatswain’s
mates and yeomen, 4 gunner’s mates and yeomen, with 18 quarter-gunners,
1 carpenter’s mate, with 8 assistants, and 1 steward and steward’s mate under
the purser.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ships of the fourth rate mount from 60 to 50 guns, upon two decks, and
the quarter-deck. The lower tier is composed of 24 pounders, the upper
tier of 12 pounders, and the cannon on the quarter-deck and fore-castle are
6 pounders. The complement of a 50 gun ship is 350 men, in which there
are three lieutenants, 2 master’s mates, 10 midshipmen, 2 surgeon’s mates,
8 quarter-masters and their mates, 4 boatswain’s mates and yeomen, 1 gunner’s
mate and 1 yeoman, with 12 quarter-gunners, 1 carpenter’s mate and
6 assistants, and a steward and steward’s mate.</p>

<p class='c008'>All vessels of war, under the fourth rate, are usually comprehended under
the general name of frigates, and never appear in the line of battle. They
are divided into the 5th and 6th rates, the former mounting from 40 to 32
guns, and the latter from 28 to 20. The largest of the fifth rate have two
decks of cannon, the lower battery being of 18 pounders, and that of the
upper-deck of 9 pounders; but those of 36 and 32 guns have only one
complete deck of guns, mounting 12 pounders, besides the quarter-deck
and fore-castle, which carry 6 pounders. The complement of a ship of 44
guns, is 280 men and that of a frigate of 36 guns, 240 men. The first
has 3, and the second 2 lieutenants; and both have 2 master’s mates, 6 midshipmen,
2 surgeon’s mates, 6 quarter-masters and their mates, 2 boatswain’s
mates and 1 yeoman, 1 gunner’s mate and 1 yeoman, with 10 or 11 quarter-gunners,
and 1 purser’s steward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frigates of the 6th rate carry 9 pounders, those of 28 guns having 3
pounders on their quarter-deck, with 200 men for their complement; and
those of 24, 160 men; the former has 2 lieutenants, the latter, 1; and both
have 2 master’s mates, 4 midshipmen, 1 surgeon’s mate, 4 quarter-masters
and their mates, 1 boatswain’s mate and 1 yeoman, 1 gunner’s mate and
1 yeoman, with 6 or 7 quarter-gunners, and 1 purser’s steward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sloops of war carry from 18 to 8 cannon, the largest of which have
6 pounders; and the smallest, viz. those of 8 and 10 guns, 4 pounders.
Their officers are generally the same as in the 6th rates, with little variation;
and their complements of men are from 120 to 60, in proportion to their
force or magnitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>N. B. Bomb-vessels are on the same establishment as sloops; but fire-ships
and hospital-ships are on that of fifth rates.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having already exhibited the dimensions of the largest first rate in our
navy, we have, in the following table, collected those of the inferior rates:</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing more evidently manifests the great improvement of the marine
art, and the degree of perfection to which it has arrived in England, than
the facility of managing our first rates; which were formerly esteemed incapable
of government, unless in the most favourable weather of the summer.
In testimony of this observation we may, with great propriety, produce
the example of the Royal George, which, during the whole course of
the late war, was known to be as easily navigated, and as capable of service,
as any of the inferior ships of the <i>line</i>, and that frequently in the most tempestuous
seasons of the year. The ingenious M. Du Hamel, who is eminently
distinguished for his knowledge of marine affairs, has indeed judiciously
objected to the defects and bad qualities of such large ships<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a>. It is
nevertheless hardly possible for any Englishman, who was witness to the defeat
of M. Conflans, by the victorious Sir Edward Hawke, on the ever-memorable
20th of November, without dissenting a while from that gentleman’s opinion.
In reality, a fact, confirmed by repeated experience, must unavoidably
triumph over all theoretical conclusions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ships of the second rate, and those of the third, which have three decks,
carry their sails remarkably well, and labour very little at sea. They are
excellent in a general action, or in cannonading a fortress. Those of the
third rate, which have two tiers, are fit for the line of battle, to lead the
convoys and squadrons of ships of war in action, and in general, to suit
the different exigencies of the naval service.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fourth rates may be employed on the same occasions as the third rates,
and may be also destined amongst the foreign colonies, or on expeditions of
great distance; since these vessels are usually excellent for keeping and
sustaining the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vessels of the fifth rate are too weak to suffer the shock of a line of battle;
but they may be destined to lead the convoys of merchant-ships, to protect
the commerce in the colonies, to cruize in different stations, to accompany
squadrons, or be sent express with necessary intelligence and orders. The
same may be observed of the sixth rates.</p>

<p class='c008'>The frigates, which mount from 28 to 38 guns upon one deck, with the
quarter-deck, are extremely proper for cruizing against privateers, or for
short expeditions, being light, long, and usually excellent sailers.</p>

<p class='c008'>RATTLINGS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enflechures</span></i>, certain small lines which traverse the <i>shrouds</i>
of a ship horizontally, at regular distances from the deck, upwards, and
forming a variety of ladders, whereby to climb to any of the mast-heads,
or descend from them. Hence the term is apparently derived from <i>rath</i>, an
obsolete word, signifying an hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to prevent the rattling from slipping down by the weight of the
sailors, they are firmly attached by a knot, called a <i>clove-hitch</i>, to all the
shrouds, except the foremost or aftmost; where one of the ends, being fitted
with an eye-splice, is previously fastened with twine or packthread.</p>

<p class='c008'>REACH, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ræcan</span></i>, Sax.) the line, or distance, comprehended between
any two points or stations on the banks of a river, wherein the current
flows in a streight uninterrupted course.</p>

<p class='c008'>REAR, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arriere</span></i>, Fr.) a name given to the last division of a squadron, or
the last squadron of a fleet, and which is accordingly commanded by the
third officer of the said fleet or squadron. See the article <span class='sc'>Division</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>REEF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ris</span></i>, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">reef</span></i>, Dutch) a certain portion of a sail, comprehended between
the top or bottom, and a row of eyelet-holes parallel thereto.</p>

<p class='c008'>The intention of the reef is to reduce the surface of the sail in proportion
to the increase of the wind; for which reason there are several reefs
parallel to each other in the superior sails, whereby they may be still farther
diminished, in order to correspond with the several degrees of the gale.
Thus the top-sails of ships are usually furnished with three reefs, <i>l</i> <i>m</i> <i>n</i>, fig. 1.
plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. parallel to the yard; and there are always three or four reefs,
parallel to the bottom on those main-sails and fore-sails, which are extended
upon booms: a circumstance common to many of the small vessels.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Reef</span> also implies a chain of rocks, lying near the surface of the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>REEF-BAND, a piece of canvas, sewed across the sail, to strengthen it
in the place where the eyelet-holes of the reefs are formed.</p>

<p class='c008'>REEFING, the operation of reducing a sail, by taking in one or more
of the reefs, which is either performed by lines, <i>points</i>, or <i>knittles</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the top-sails are always, and the courses generally, reefed with points,
which are flat braided pieces of cordage, whose lengths are nearly double
the circumference of the yard. These being inserted in the eyelet-holes,
are fixed in the sail by means of two knots in the middle, one of which is
before, and the other behind the reef-band.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to reef the top-sails with more facility and expedition, they are
lowered down and made to <i>shiver</i> in the wind, which considerably relaxes
their tension. The extremities of the reef are then drawn up to the <i>yard-arms</i>
by an assemblage of pullies communicating with the deck, termed the <i>reef-tackle</i>;
and they are securely fastened to the yard-arms by small cords, called
<i>earings</i>. The space of sail, comprehended in the reef, is then laid smoothly
over the yard, in several folds, or doubles: and the whole is completed by
tying the points about the yard, so as to bind the reef close up to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The courses of large ships are either reefed with points or small cords,
which are thence called <i>reef-lines</i>. In the latter case the line is passed spirally
through the eyelet-holes of the reef, and over the head of the sail alternately,
and afterwards strained as tight as possible. It must be observed,
however, that the reef-line is sometimes passed round the yard, and sometimes
only round the head of the sail; and each of these methods have their
advocates, with arguments more or less convincing. But if it should appear
essential to prevent the friction by which a sail is galled between the line and
the yard; and as the rope-bands are sufficient to sustain the effort of the
sail, it is certainly much better to pass the line only round the sail, provided
that the turns are inserted through the <i>roband-legs</i>; a circumstance which is
carefully practised by every skilful sailor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same reason may be alledged, with equal propriety, in favour of
tying the points of the courses in the same manner; that is to say, the after-end
of the point should be thrust forward between the head of the sail and
the yard; and the fore-leg of the said point should come aft over the head
of the sail, and also under the yard: and thus crossed over the head of the
sail, the point should be extended, and the two ends brought over the yard,
and tied on the upper side of it as strait as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a sail is reefed at the bottom, it is done by <i>knittles</i>, which being
thrust through the eyelet-holes thereof, are tied firmly about the space of
canvas of which the reef is composed, and knotted on the lower side of the
bolt-rope. These knittles are accordingly removed as soon as the reef is let
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the manner above described, there are other methods of reducing
a sail to the storm, as explained in the articles <span class='sc'>Goose-Wing</span> and <span class='sc'>Balance</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>REEF-TACKLE, a rope which passes from the deck to a <i>block</i> at the
topmast-head, and thence to another block at the topsail-yard-arm, where it
communicates with another rope, called its <i>pendant</i>, that runs downwards
through a hole in the yard, and is afterwards attached to a <i>cringle</i>, a little below
the lowest reef, as exhibited by fig. 1. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. where <i>b</i> is the reef-tackle, and
<i>i</i> the pendant thereof. It is used, as we have already observed, to pull the
skirts of the reefs close up to the extremities of the topsail-yards, in order
to lighten the sail, the weight of which would otherwise render it very difficult
to perform this operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>REEL <i>of the log</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Log</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> REEVE, is to pass the end of a rope through any hole, as the channel
of a block, the cavity of a thimble, cleat, ring-bolt, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>RECKONING. See <span class='sc'>Dead-Reckoning</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>REFITTING, is generally understood to imply the repairing any damages,
which a ship may have sustained in her sails or rigging, by battle
or tempestuous weather; but more particularly by the former. See <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>
and <span class='sc'>Repair</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>REIGNING-WINDS, a name given to the winds which usually prevail
on any particular coast or region, the knowledge of which is essentially
necessary to every pilot who is charged with the navigation in those seas.</p>

<p class='c008'>RELIEVING-TACKLES, two strong tackles, used to prevent a ship from
overturning on the <i>careen</i>, and to assist in bringing her upright after that
operation is compleated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The relieving-tackles are furnished with two strong <i>guys</i>, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attrapes</span></i>) or
<i>pendants</i>, by which their efforts are communicated, under the ship’s bottom,
to the opposite side, where the ends of the guys are attached to the lower gun-ports.
The other ends of the tackles are hooked to the wharf, or <i>pontoon</i>,
by which the vessel is careened. Thus if the ship is first to be laid down on
the larboard-side, which is nearest the wharf, the relieving-tackles are passed
under her bottom from the said wharf, and attached to the starboard-side,
by which they will restrain her from falling lower than is necessary. See
<i>Righting</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Relieving-Tackle</span>, is also a name sometimes given to the train-tackles
of a gun-carriage. See <span class='sc'>Cannon</span> and <span class='sc'>Exercise</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RENDERING, as a sea-term, is generally understood to be the effect of
yielding, or giving way, without resistance, to the efforts of some mechanical
power. It is usually expressed of a complicated tackle, <i>laniard</i>, or <i>lashing</i>,
when the effect of the power applied is communicated with facility to all
the parts, without being interrupted in its passage. It is therefore used in
contra-distinction to sticking or jamming.</p>

<p class='c008'>RENDEVOUS, the port, or place of destination, where the several ships
of a fleet or squadron are appointed to rejoin the whole, in case of a separation,
occasioned by tempestuous weather, or other unforeseen accident.</p>

<p class='c008'>REPAIR, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">radoub</span></i>, the operation of amending any injuries, or supplying
any deficiencies, which a ship may have received by age, battle, tempestuous
weather, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The repair is necessarily greater or smaller, in proportion to the loss which
the vessel has sustained. Accordingly a suitable number of the <i>timbers</i>,
<i>beams</i>, or <i>planks</i>, or a sufficient part of either, are removed, and new
pieces fixed in their places. The whole is completed by <i>breaming</i>, <i>calking</i>,
and <i>paying</i> the body with a new composition of stuff. See <span class='sc'>Docking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>REPRISE, a ship which is retaken from the enemy, soon after the first
capture; or at least before she has arrived in any neutral or hostile port.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a vessel, thus retaken, has been twenty-four hours in the possession of
the enemy, it is deemed a lawful prize; but if it be retaken within that
time, it is to be restored to the proprietor, with every thing therein, upon
his allowing one-third to the vessel who made the reprise. Also if the reprise
has been abandoned by the enemy, either in a tempest, or from any
other cause, before it has been led into any port, it is to be restored to the
proprietor.</p>

<p class='c008'>RETREAT, the order or disposition in which a fleet of French men of
war decline engagement, or fly from a pursuing enemy<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RHOMB-LINE, a line prolonged from any point of the compass on a
nautical chart, except the four cardinal points.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIBBANDS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lisses</span></i>, (from <i>rib</i> and <i>bend</i>) in naval architecture, long narrow
flexible pieces of timber, nailed upon the outside of the ribs, from the <i>stem</i>
the <i>stern-post</i>, so as to envelop the ship lengthways, and appear on her
side and bottom like the meridians on the surface of the globe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ribbands, being judiciously arranged with regard to their height
and distance from each other, and forming regular sweeps about the ship’s
body, will compose a kind of frame, whose interior surface will determine
the curve of all the intermediate, or filling-timbers, which are stationed between
the principal ones. As the figure of the ship’s bottom approaches to
that of a conoid, and the ribbands having a limited breadth, it is apparent,
that they cannot be applied to this convex surface without forming a
double curve, which will be partly vertical and partly horizontal; so that
the vertical curve will increase by approaching the stem, and still more
by drawing near the stern-post. It is also evident, that by deviating from
the middle line of the ship’s length, as they approach the extreme breadth
at the <i>midship-frame</i>, the ribbands will also form an horizontal curve. The
lowest of these, which is terminated upon the stem and stern-post, at the
height of the <i>rising-line of the floor</i>, and answers to the upper part of the
floor-timber upon the midship-frame, is called the <i>floor</i>-ribband. That which
coincides with the <i>wing-transom</i>, at the height of the lower-deck upon the
midship-frame, is termed the <i>breadth</i>-ribband: all the rest, which are placed
between these two, are called intermediate ribbands.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this double curve it results, that the ribbands will appear in different
points of view, when delineated upon different planes of the same
ship. To conceive this, let us suppose the skeleton of a ship upon the stocks,
as in plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. fig. 11. and plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. fig. 2. with the ribbands represented by
dotted lines upon her bottom, If a spectator is placed opposite to the
stem or stern-post, on a line prolonged from the keel, he will only view
the projection of the ribbands on the plane of the midship-frame, in which
the horizontal curve is very little perceived; he will discover part of the
vertical curve, which rises continually from the extreme breadth towards the
stem and stern, so that they must be drawn upon the plane of projection as
oblique lines, which terminate upon the midship-frame at the point where
the ribband touches it, and upon the stem and stern-post at the point
where their ends are lodged.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the spectator were to change his position, and perceive the projection of
the ribbands upon a plane, supposed to be elevated upon the length of the
keel, he would also discover their vertical curve, as it is sometimes expressed
in the sheer-draught, without distinguishing the horizontal one.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if we imagine the eye of the spectator placed considerably above the
ship, on a line perpendicular to the middle of the keel, he will then discover
the projection of the ribbands upon the plane of the ground beneath the
ship, and view the horizontal curve, (see the <i>horizontal plane</i>, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.) without
perceiving the perpendicular one.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to give the reader as distinct an idea as possible of the ribbands,
we have, besides the above representations, exhibited a perspective view of
them in the frame or skeleton of a small vessel, referred to, from the article
<span class='sc'>Timber</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIBS <i>of a ship</i>, a figurative expression for the timbers. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ribs</span> <i>of a parrel</i>. See <span class='sc'>Parrel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIDERS, a sort of interior ribs, fixed occasionally in a ship’s hold opposite
to some of the principal timbers, and reaching from the kelson to the
beams of the lower-deck, and sometimes higher, in order to strengthen her
frame. They are bolted to the other timbers, to support them when it is
apprehended the ship is not sufficiently strong in the part where they are
fixed; which is generally amidships.</p>

<p class='c008'>The riders have also their floor-pieces and futtocks, and sometimes their
top-pieces, all of which are scarfed to each other in the same manner as
in the timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The riders ought to be stationed so as to lie between two ports of the
lower deck, and to correspond with the timbers to which they are attached,
in such a manner, as that the scarfs of the riders may be clear of
those of the timbers. They are scored upon the kelson, clamps, and thick-stuff
of the bottom. They are secured by bolts, which are driven from
without, so as to penetrate the outside planks, the timbers, the clamps, and
the riders; on the inside of which last they are fore-locked. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>These pieces are rarely used in merchant-ships, because they would be extremely
inconvenient in the hold, besides occupying too large a space thereof;
neither are they always used in vessels of war, at least till after the ship is enfeebled
by several cruizes at sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIDGE, a long assemblage of rocks, lying near the surface of the sea, so
as to intercept the passage of a ship under sail. See also <span class='sc'>Reef</span> and <span class='sc'>Shallow</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIDING, when expressed of a ship, is the state of being retained in a particular
station, by means of one or more cables with their anchors, which are
for this purpose sunk into the bottom of the sea, &amp;c. in order to prevent the
vessel from being driven at the mercy of the wind or current. See <span class='sc'>Mooring</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Riding</span> <i>athwart</i>, the position of a ship which lies across the direction of
the wind and tide, when the former is so strong as to prevent her from

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Riding</span> <i>between the wind and tide</i>, the situation of a vessel at anchor, when,
the wind and tide act upon her in direct opposition; in such a manner as to
destroy the effort of each other upon her hull; so that she is in a manner
balanced between their reciprocal force, and rides without the least strain on
her cables.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship does not labour heavily, or feel a great strain when anchored
in an open road or bay, she is said to ride easy. On the contrary, when she
pitches violently into the sea, so as to strain her cables, masts, or hull, it
is called riding hard, and the vessel is termed a bad roader.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship is rarely said to ride when she is fastened at both the ends, as in a
harbour or river, that situation being comprehended in the article <span class='sc'>Mooring</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIGGING, a general name given to all the ropes employed to support
the masts; and to extend or reduce the sails, or arrange them to the disposition
of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The former, which are used to sustain the masts, remain usually in a fixed
position, and are called <i>standing</i> rigging; such are the <i>shrouds</i>, <i>stays</i>, and
<i>back-stays</i>. The latter, whose office is to manage the sails, by communicating
with various blocks, or pullies, situated in different places of the <i>masts</i>, <i>yards</i>,
<i>shrouds</i>, &amp;c. are comprehended in the general term of <i>running</i>-rigging. Such
are the <i>braces</i>, <i>sheets</i>, <i>haliards</i>, <i>clue-lines</i>, <i>brails</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>In rigging a mast, the first thing usually fixed upon its head, is a circular
wreath of rope, called the <i>grommet</i>, or collar, which is firmly beat down
upon the top of the <i>hounds</i>. The intent of this is to prevent the shrouds
from being fretted or worn by the <i>tressel-trees</i>, or shoulders of the mast;
after this are laid on the two <i>pendants</i>, from whose lower ends the main, or
fore-tackles are suspended; and next, the <i>shrouds</i> of the starboard and larboard
side, in pairs, alternately. The whole is covered by the <i>stays</i>, which
are the largest ropes of the rigging.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a yard is to be rigged, a grommet is also driven first on each of its
extremities: next to this are fitted-on the <i>horses</i>, the <i>braces</i>; and, lastly, the
<i>lifts</i>, or <i>top-sail sheet</i>-blocks: all of which are explained in their proper
places.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal objects to be considered in rigging a ship appear to be
strength, convenience, and simplicity; or the properties of affording sufficient
security to the masts, yards, and sails; of arranging the whole machinery
in the most advantageous manner, to sustain the masts, and facilitate
the management of the sails; and of avoiding perplexity, and rejecting whatever
is superfluous or unnecessary. The perfection of this art then consists
in retaining all those qualities, and in preserving a judicious medium between
them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Rigging-out</span> <i>a boom</i>, the operation of running out a pole upon the end
of a yard, or bowsprit, to extend the foot of a sail. These booms are confined
in those places by double rings, formed like a figure of 8, one part of
which is fastened to the respective yard-arm, or bowsprit-end, and the other
receives the boom, which is occasionally rigged out, or drawn in through it.
The rings used in this service are termed <i>boom-irons</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIGHTING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">relever</span></i>, the act of restoring a ship to her upright position,
after she has been laid on a <i>careen</i>, by the mechanical powers usually applied
in that operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is generally the natural effect of casting loose the careening pullies by
which she had been drawn down. It is however necessary sometimes to apply
mechanical powers to right the ship in such a situation. The principal of
these are the relieving-tackles. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship is also said to right at sea when she rises, with her masts erected,
after having been prest down on one side by the effort of her sails, or a heavy
squall of wind.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Righting</span>, when expressed of the helm, implies the replacing it in the
middle of the ship, after having produced the required effect, of wheeling
her to the right or left, as much as appeared necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIM, or BRIM, a name given to the circular edge of any of the <i>tops</i>.
See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>RING-BOLT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheville à boucle</span></i>, an iron bolt, with an eye at one end,
wherein is fitted a circular ring, as expressed in fig. 3. and 4. plate <a href='#II'>II</a>. The
ring bolts are for several uses, but particularly to hook the <i>tackles</i>, by which
the cannon of a ship are managed and secured: accordingly there is one fixed
in the deck opposite to every cannon, represented by Z, plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. <span class='sc'>Deck</span>:
and they are, for the same purpose, fixed in the edges of the gun-ports, as
expressed in the <span class='sc'>Midship-frame</span>, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>. They are driven through the
plank and the corresponding beam, or timber, and retained in this position
by a small pin thrust through a hole in the small end, as appears in fig. 39,
plate <a href='#II'>II</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RING-ROPES, short pieces of rope, tied occasionally to the ring-bolts
of the deck, to fasten the cable more securely when the ship rides in a tempest,
or turbulent sea, or rapid current. They are, however, more particularly
necessary in veering away the cable gradually in those circumstances,
in order to <i>freshen the hause</i>; as, without this precaution, it would be extremely
difficult to check the cable, which, being then charged with a great
effort, might be drawn violently out of the ship at random.</p>

<p class='c008'>RING-TAIL, a small triangular sail, extended on a little mast, which is
occasionally erected for that purpose on the top of a ship’s stern. The
lower part of this sail is stretched out by a boom, which projects from the
stern horizontally. This sail is only used in light and favourable winds, particularly
in the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ring-tail</span> is also a name given to a sort of <i>studding-sail</i>, hoisted beyond
the after-edge, or skirt of those main-sails which are extended by a <i>boom</i>
and gaff; as in all <i>sloops</i>, <i>brigs</i>, and <i>schooners</i>: this ring-tail is accordingly of
the same depth with that part of the main-sail upon which it borders. See
<span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RIPPLING, a broken and interrupted noise, produced by a current on or
near the sea-coast.</p>

<p class='c008'>RISING-LINE, a name given by shipwrights to an incurvated line, which
is drawn on the plane of elevation, to determine the height of the ends of
all the <i>floor-timbers</i> throughout the ship’s length, and which accordingly
ascertains the figure of the bottom, with regard to sharpness and flatness.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROAD, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rade</span></i>, Fr.) a bay, or place of anchorage, at some distance
from the shore, on the sea-coast, whither ships or vessels occasionally repair to
receive intelligence, orders, or necessary supplies; or to wait for a fair wind,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The excellence of a road consists chiefly in its being protected from the
reigning winds, and the swell of the sea; in having a good <i>anchoring-ground</i>,
and being at a competent distance from the shore. Those which are not
sufficiently enclosed are termed open roads.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROADER, a vessel riding at anchor in a road, bay, or river. If a vessel
under sail strikes against any roader, and damages her in passing, the former
is obliged by law to make good the damages sustained by the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roaders attentively observe to anchor, or moor, at a competent distance
from each other; and that those which arrive last shall not moor in the tract
of the shipping which anchored before, so as to intercept their passage when
they are ready to depart.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROBANDS, or ROPE-BANDS. See <span class='sc'>Rope-Band</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROGUES-YARN, a name given to a rope-yarn, of a particular construction,
which is placed, in the middle of every <i>strand</i>, in all cables and
cordage in the king’s service. It differs from all the rest, as being untarred,
and twisted in a contrary manner, by which it is easily discovered. The
use of this contrivance is to examine whether any cordage, supposed to be
stolen or embezzled, has been formed for the king’s service.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROLLER, a cylindrical piece of timber, fixed either horizontally or
perpendicularly above a ship’s deck, so as to revolve about an axis. It is
used to prevent the <i>cables</i>, <i>hausers</i>, &amp;c. from being chafed by the friction
which their surfaces would otherwise encounter, from bearing against that
part of the ship, where the roller is placed, whilst they are drawn into the
ship, &amp;c. by mechanical powers.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Rollers</span>, are also moveable pieces of wood, of the same figure, which
are occasionally placed under planks, or long pieces of timber, in order to
move them with greater facility either in the <i>dock</i>-yards, or in lading and delivering
merchant-ships.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROLLING, the motion by which a ship rocks from side-to side like a
cradle, occasioned by the agitation of the waves.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Rolling</span>, therefore, is a sort of revolution about an imaginary axis, passing
through the center of gravity of a ship: so that the nearer the center of gravity
is to the keel, the more violent will be the rolling-motion; because the
center about which the vibrations are made, is placed so low in the bottom,
that the resistance made by the keel to the volume of water which it displaces
in rolling, bears very little proportion to the force of the vibration above the
center of gravity, the radius of which extends as high as the mast-heads.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the center of gravity is placed higher above the keel, the radius of
vibration will not only be diminished; but an additional force to oppose the
motion of rolling will be communicated to that part of the ship’s bottom
which is below the center of gravity.</p>

<p class='c008'>So far as relates to the effect of rolling, when produced by the quality or
stowage of the ballast, and to the manner by which it may be prevented, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>
a change of the quantity or disposition of the ballast, we shall endeavour to
explain under the article <span class='sc'>Trim</span>. It may, however, be necessary to remark,
that the construction of the ship’s bottom may also contribute to diminish this
movement considerably.</p>

<p class='c008'>To illustrate this by an example, let us suppose the section of a ship perpendicular
to the keel to be exactly circular, plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. fig. 8. it is evident,
that if this be agitated in the water, it will have nothing to sustain it, because
the rolling or rotation about its center displaces no more water than when it
remains upright: consequently the rolling motion must be very great in a
high sea. But if a plank is fixed below it edgeways, or perpendicular to the
surface, as low as <i>e</i>, throughout the whole length of the ship, it is plain that
the plank e will displace a volume of water to the right, when the ship is inclined
to the left, which will retard her motion; and this obstruction will always
act contrary to her <i>heeling</i> or inclination to one side, and greatly diminish
the vibration or rolling; although it will add very little to her stiffness: For,
admitting the ship to incline to one side, as in fig. 8. the plank <i>d e</i> would
produce a very weak effort to bring her upright. But the depth of the keel,
the rising of the floors, and the dead wood fore and aft, as in fig. 9. plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>.
will answer the same purpose as the plank <i>d e</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many fatal disasters have happened to ships, arising from a violent rolling;
as the loss of the masts, loosening of the cannon, and straining violently on
the decks and sides, so as to weaken the ship to a great degree. See <span class='sc'>Ballast</span>,
<span class='sc'>Labouring</span>, and <span class='sc'>Pitching</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Rolling-tackle</span>, a pulley or purchase fastened to that part of a sail-yard
which is to the windward of the mast, in order to confine the yard close down
to the leeward, when the sail is furled.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is used to prevent the yard from having a great friction against the mast
in a high sea, which would be equally pernicious to both.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROPES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordes</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">rap</span></i>, Sax. <i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">reep</span></i>, Dutch) a general name given to all
sorts of cordage, above one inch in circumference, used in the rigging a
ship. See <span class='sc'>Cable</span>, <span class='sc'>Hauser</span>, <span class='sc'>Towline</span>, and <span class='sc'>Warp</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ropes</span> are either cable-laid or hauser-laid: the former are composed of
nine <i>strands</i>, viz. three great strands, each of which is composed of three
smaller strands; and the latter is made with three strands, each of which contains
a certain number of rope-yarns, in proportion to the size of the rope required.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Rope-bands</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rabans</span></i>, pronounced roebins, certain pieces of small rope, or
braided cordage, used to tie the upper edges of the great sails to their respective
yards. They are inserted through the eyelet-holes in the head of the
sail, being generally of a sufficient length to pass two or three times about the
said yard.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Rope-yarn</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fil de caret</span></i>, the smallest and simplest part of any rope, being
one of the threads of which a <i>strand</i> is composed; so that the size of the latter,
and of the rope into which it is twisted, are determined by the number of rope-yarns.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROVER, a pirate or free-booter. See <span class='sc'>Pirate</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROUGH-TREE, a name given in merchant-ships to any mast, yard, or
boom, placed as a rail or fence above the ship’s side, from the quarter-deck
to the fore-castle. It is, however, with more propriety, applied to any mast,
&amp;c. which remains rough and unfinished.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROUND-HOUSE, a name given, in East-Indiamen, and other large
merchant-ships, to a cabin or apartment built in the after part of the quarterdeck,
and having the poop for its roof. This apartment is usually called
the coach in our ships of war.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROUNDING, certain old ropes wound firmly and closely about that part
of a cable which lies in the <i>hause</i>, or under the ship’s <i>bow</i>, or athwart the stem.
It is used to prevent the surface of the cable from being chafed or fretted in
those places. See the articles <span class='sc'>Kaicling</span> and <span class='sc'>Service</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Rounding-in</span> generally implies the act of pulling upon any rope which
passes through one or more blocks, in a direction nearly horizontal; as,
round-in the weather-braces! &amp;c. It is apparently derived from the circular
motion of the rope about the <i>sheave</i> or pulley through which it passes.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Rounding-up</span> is used nearly in the same sense, only that it is expressed of a
<i>tackle</i> which hangs in a perpendicular position, without sustaining or hoisting
any weighty body: it is then the operation of pulling the blocks closer to
each other, by means of the rope which passes through them, to compose the
tackle; and is therefore opposed to <i>over-hauling</i>, by which the blocks are
drawn farther asunder.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROUSSING, the act of pulling together upon a cable, hauser, &amp;c.
without the assistance of <i>tackles</i>, <i>capsterns</i>, or other mechanical powers. It is
particularly used in the exercise of removing a ship from one place to another,
by means of ropes and anchors. See the article <span class='sc'>Warping</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> ROW, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ramer</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">rowan</span></i>, Sax.) to impel a boat or vessel along the surface
of the water by oars, which are managed in a direction nearly horizontal.
See <span class='sc'>Oar</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Row-galley.</span> See the article <span class='sc'>Galley</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Row-locks</span>, those parts of the <i>gunwale</i>, or upper edge of a boat’s side,
whereon the oar rests in the exercise of rowing. In the sides of the smallest
vessels of war, a number of little square holes, called row-ports, are cut for
this purpose, parallel to the surface of the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROWERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rameurs</span></i>, a name given to the persons by whom the oars are
managed.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROWING-GUARD. See <span class='sc'>Guard-Boat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>ROYAL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulingue</span></i>, a name given to the highest sail which is extended in
any ship. It is spread immediately above the top-gallant-sail, to whose yardarms
the lower corners of it are attached. This sail is never used but in light
and favourable breezes.</p>

<p class='c008'>RUDDER. See the article <span class='sc'>Helm</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RUN, the aftmost or hindmost part of a ship’s bottom, where it grows
extremely narrow, as the floor approaches the stern-post.</p>

<p class='c008'>RUNG-HEADS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs</span></i>, a name sometimes given by shipwrights to the upper
ends of the floor-timbers, which are otherwise more properly called floor-heads.
See <span class='sc'>Naval Architecture</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>RUNNER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">itague</span></i>, a thick rope used to increase the mechanical powers
of a <i>tackle</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>The runner <i>a</i>, fig. 10. plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. passes through a large hook-block, as
<i>c</i>, and has usually a hook <i>b</i> attached to one of its ends, and one of the
tackle-blocks to the other; and in applying it, the hook, as well as the lower
block of the corresponding tackle, is fixed to the object intended to be removed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>RUNNING-out</span> <i>a warp</i>, the act of carrying the end of a rope out from
the ship, in a boat, and fastening it to some distant place, to remove the
ship towards the said place, or keep her steddy whilst her anchors are lifted,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Running-rigging</span>, all that part of a ship’s rigging which passes through
the blocks, to dilate, contract, or traverse the sails. See the article <span class='sc'>Rigging</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>S.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>SADDLE, a small <i>cleat</i> or wooden block, hollowed on the upper and lower
side, and nailed on the lower <i>yard-arms</i>, to retain the studding-sail-<i>booms</i>
in a firm and steddy position. For this purpose the cavity on the lower
part of the saddle conforms to the cylindrical surface of the yard to which it
is attached: and in like manner the hollow, on the upper side, answers to the
figure of the boom, and serves as a channel whereby it may be run out or in,
along the yard, as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>SAGGING <i>to leeward</i>, the movement by which a ship makes a considerable
<i>lee-way</i>, or is driven far to leeward of the course whereon she apparently
sails. It is generally expressed of heavy-sailing vessels, as opposed to keeping
well to windward, or, in the sea-phrase, holding a good wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>SAIC, a sort of Grecian ketch, which has no top-gallant-sail or mizen-top-sail.
See <span class='sc'>Ketch</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SAIL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voile</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">segl</span></i>, Sax. <i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">seyhel</span></i>, <i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">seyl</span></i> Dutch) an assemblage of several
breadths of canvas, or other texture, sewed together, and extended on, or between
the <i>masts</i>, to receive the wind, and carry the vessel along the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>The edges of the <i>cloths</i>, or pieces, of which a sail is composed, are generally
sewed together with a double seam: and the whole is skirted round at the
edges with a cord, called the <i>bolt-rope</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the form of sails is extremely different, they are all nevertheless
triangular or quadrilateral figures or, in other words, their surfaces are contained
either between three or four sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>The former of these are sometimes spread by a <i>yard</i>, as <i>lateen</i>-sails; and
otherwise by a <i>stay</i>, as <i>stay</i>-sails; or by a mast, as shoulder-of-mutton-sails:
in all which cases the foremost <i>leech</i> or edge is attached to the said yard, mast,
or stay, throughout its whole length. The latter, or those which are four-sided,
are either extended by yards, as the principal sails of a ship; or by yards
and booms, as the <i>studding</i>-sails, <i>drivers</i>, <i>ring-tails</i>, and all those sails which
are set occasionally; or by <i>gaffs</i> and booms, as the <i>main-sails</i> of <i>sloops</i> and
<i>brigantines</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal sails of a ship (fig. 1. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>.) are the courses or lower
sails <i>a</i>, the <i>top-sails b</i>, which are next in order above the courses; and the
top-gallant-sails <i>c</i>, which are expanded above the top-sails.</p>

<p class='c008'>The courses are the main-sail, fore-sail, and mizen, main-stay-sail, fore-stay-sail
and mizen-stay-sail; but more particularly the three first. <i>N. B.</i> The
main-stay-sail is rarely used except in small vessels.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all quadrangular sails the upper edge is called the head; the sides or
skirts are called leeches; and the bottom or lower edge is termed the foot.
If the head is parallel to the foot, the two lower corners are denominated
<i>clues</i>, and the upper corners earings.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all triangular sails, and in those four-sided sails wherein the head is not
parallel to the foot, the foremost corner at the foot is called the tack; and the
after lower-corner the clue; the foremost perpendicular or sloping edge is
called the <i>fore</i> leech, and the hindmost the <i>after</i> leech.</p>

<p class='c008'>The heads of all four-sided sails, and the fore-leeches of lateen sails, are
attached to their respective yard or gaff by a number of small cords called robands;
and the extremities are tied to the yard-arms, or to the peek of the
gaff, by <i>earings</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stay-sails are extended upon stays between the masts, whereon they are
drawn up or down occasionally, as a curtain slides upon its rod, and their
lower parts are stretched out by a tack and sheet. The clues of a top-sail are
drawn out to the extremities of the lower yard, by two large ropes called the
top-sail sheets; and the clues of the top-gallant-sails are in like manner extended
upon the top-sail yard-arms, as exhibited by plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. fig. 1.</p>

<p class='c008'>The studding-sails are set beyond the leeches or skirts of the main-sail and
fore-sail, or of the top-sails or top-gallant-sails of a ship. Their upper and
lower edges are accordingly extended by poles run out beyond the extremities
of the yards for this purpose. Those sails however are only set in favourable
winds and moderate weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>All sails derive their name from the mast, yard, or stay upon which they are
extended. Thus the principal sail extended upon the main-mast is called the
main-sail, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande voile</span></i>, <i>d</i>, fig. 2. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>.; the next above, which stands
upon the main-top-mast, is termed the main top-sail, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand hunier</span></i>, <i>e</i>; and the
highest, which is spread across the main-top-gallant-mast, is named the main-top-gallant-sail,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand perroquet</span></i>, <i>f</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same manner there is the fore-sail, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">misaine</span></i>, <i>g</i>; the fore-top-sail, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit
hunier</span></i>, <i>h</i>; and the fore-top-gallant-sail, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit perroquet</span></i>, <i>i</i>; the mizen, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artimon</span></i>,
<i>k</i>; the mizen top-sail, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perroquet d’artimon</span></i>, <i>l</i>; and mizen top-gallant-sail <i>m</i>.
Thus also there is the main stay-sail <i>o</i>; main-top-mast stay-sail <i>p</i>; and main-top-gallant
stay-sail <i>q</i>; with a middle stay-sail which stands between the two
last. <i>N. B.</i> All these stay-sails are between the main and fore masts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stay-sails (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voiles d’etai</span></i>) between the main-mast and mizen-mast are the
mizen stay-sail <i>r</i>; and the mizen top-mast stay-sail <i>s</i>; and sometimes a mizen
top-gallant stay-sail above the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stay-sails between the fore-mast and the bowsprit are the fore stay-sail <i>t</i>;
the fore top-mast stay-sail <i>u</i>; and the jib, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foc</span></i>, <i>x</i>. There is besides two square
sails extended by yards under the bowsprit, one of which is called the sprit-sail,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">civadiere</span></i>, <i>y</i>; and the other the sprit-sail top-sail <i>z</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perroquet de beaupré</span></i>. For
the French names of all the stay-sails, see the French term <span class='sc'>Etai</span>, and the
phrases following it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The studding-sails (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnettes en étui</span></i>) being extended upon the different
yards of the main-mast and fore-mast, are likewise named according to their
stations, the lower, top-mast, or top-gallant studding sails.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ropes by which the lower yards of a ship are hoisted up to their proper
height on the masts, are called the <i>jears</i>. In all other sails the ropes employed
for this purpose are called <i>haliards</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal sails are then expanded by haliards, sheets, and bowlines,
except the courses, which are always stretched out below by a <i>tack</i> and sheet.
See <span class='sc'>Bowline</span>, <span class='sc'>Close-hauled</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">&amp;c.</span></i> They are drawn up together, or trussed
up, by <i>bunt-lines</i>, <i>clue-lines</i>, <i>d d</i>, fig. 1.; <i>leech-lines</i>, <i>e e</i>; <i>reef-tackles</i>, <i>f f</i>;
<i>slab-line</i>, <i>g</i>; and <i>spilling-lines</i>. As the bunt-lines and leech-lines pass on the
other side of the sail, they are expressed by dotted lines in the figure. See
those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The courses, top-sails, and top-gallant sails, are wheeled about the mast,
so as to suit the various directions of the wind, by <i>braces</i>. The higher studding-sails,
and in general all the stay-sails, are drawn down, so as to be furled,
or taken in, by down-hauls. See <span class='sc'>Brace</span>, <span class='sc'>Trim</span>, and <span class='sc'>Down-haul</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sail</span> is also a name applied to any vessel beheld at a distance under sail.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To set</i> <span class='sc'>Sail</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire voile</span></i>, is to unfurl and expand the sails, upon their respective
yards and stays, in order to begin the action of sailing.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To make</i> <span class='sc'>Sail</span>, is to spread an additional quantity of sail, so as to increase
the ship’s velocity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To shorten</i> <span class='sc'>Sail</span>, is to reduce or take in part of the sails, with an intention
to diminish the ship’s velocity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To strike</i> <span class='sc'>Sail</span>, is to <i>lower</i> it suddenly. This is particularly used in <i>saluting</i>
or doing homage to a superior force, or to one whom the law of nations acknowledges
as superior in certain regions. Thus all foreign vessels strike to
an English man of war in the British seas. See <span class='sc'>Salute</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SAILING, the movement by which a vessel is wafted along the surface of
the water, by the action of the wind upon her sails.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship changes her state of rest into that of motion, as in advancing
out of a harbour, or from her station at anchor, she acquires her motion
very gradually, as a body which arrives not at a certain velocity till after an
infinite repetition of the action of its weight.</p>

<div id='IX'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/i_270.jpg'><img src='images/i_270_thumb.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i><span class='sc'>Plate. ix.</span></i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The first impression of the wind greatly affects the velocity, because the resistance
of the water might destroy it, since the velocity being but small at
first, the resistance of the water which depends on it will be very feeble: but
as the ship increases her motion, the force of the wind on the sails will be diminished;
whereas on the contrary the resistance of the water on the <i>bow</i>
will accumulate, in proportion to the velocity with which the vessel advances.
Thus the repetition of the degrees of force which the action of the sails adds
to the motion of the ship, is perpetually decreasing; whilst on the contrary
the new degrees added to the effort of resistance on the bow are always augmenting.
The velocity is then accelerated in proportion as the quantity added
is greater than that which is subtracted: but when the two powers become
equal, when the impression of the wind on the sails has lost so much of its
force, as only to act in proportion to the opposite impulse of resistance on the
bow, the ship will then acquire no additional velocity, but continue to sail with
a constant uniform motion. The great weight of the ship may indeed prevent
her from acquiring her greatest velocity; but when she has attained it,
she will advance by her own intrinsic motion, without gaining any new degree
of velocity, or lessening what she has acquired. She moves then by her
own proper force <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</span></i>, without being afterwards subject either to the effort
of the wind on the sails, or to the resistance of the water on the bow. If
at any time the impulsion of the water on the bow should destroy any part of
the velocity, the effort of the wind on the sails will revive it, so that the motion
will continue the same. It must however be observed, that this state will
only subsist when these two powers act upon each other in direct opposition;
otherwise they will mutually destroy one another. The whole theory of
working ships depends on this counter-action, and the perfect equality which
should subsist between the effort of the wind and the impulsion of the water.
<i>Bouguer</i>, <cite>Traité du navire</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The effect of sailing is produced by a judicious arrangement of the sails to
the direction of the wind. Accordingly the various modes of sailing are derived
from the different degrees and situations of the wind with regard to the
course of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>To illustrate this observation by examples, the plan of a number of ships
proceeding on various courses are represented by fig. 3. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. which exhibits
the thirty-two points of the compass, of which C is the center: the direction
of the wind, which is northerly, being expressed by the arrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been observed in the article <span class='sc'>Close-hauled</span>, that a ship in that situation
will sail nearly within six points of the wind. Thus the ships B and <i>y</i>
are close-hauled, the former being on the larboard <i>tack</i>, steering E. N. E.
and the latter on the starboard tack sailing W. N. W. with their yards <i>a</i> <i>b</i>
braced obliquely, as suitable to that manner of sailing. The <i>line</i> of battle
on the larboard tack would accordingly be expressed by C B, and on the
starboard by C <i>y</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship is neither close-hauled, nor steering afore the wind, she is in
general said to be sailing <i>large</i>. The relation of the wind to her course is
precisely determined by the number of points between the latter and the
course <i>close-hauled</i>. Thus the ships <i>c</i> and <i>x</i> have the wind one point large,
the former steering E. <i>b</i> N. and the latter W. <i>b</i> N. The yards remain almost
in the same position as in B and <i>y</i>: the bowlines and <i>sheets</i> of the sails being
only a little slackened.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ships <i>d</i> and <i>u</i> have the wind two points large, the one steering east
and the other west. In this manner of sailing, however, the wind is more
particularly said to be upon the <i>beam</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perpendiculaire du vent</span></i>, as being at
right angles with the keel, and coinciding with the position of the ship’s
beams. The yards are now more across the ship, the bowlines are cast off,
and the sheets more relaxed; so that the effort of the wind being applied nearer
to the line of the ship’s course, her velocity is greatly augmented.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>e</i> and <i>t</i> the ships have the wind three points large, or one point <i>abaft</i>
the beam, the course of the former being E. <i>b</i> S. and that of the latter</p>

<p class='c008'>W. <i>b</i> S. The sheets are still more flowing; the angle which the yards make
with the keel farther diminished; and the course accelerated in proportion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ships <i>f</i> and <i>s</i> the first of which steers E. S. E. and the second W.S. W.
have the wind four points large, or two points abaft the beam. In <i>g</i> and <i>r</i>
the wind is five points large, or three points abaft the beam, the former sailing
S. E. <i>b</i> E. and the latter S. W. <i>b</i> W. In both these situations the sheets
are still farther slackened, and the yards laid yet more athwart the ship’s
length, in proportion as the wind approaches the <i>quarter</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ships <i>h</i> and <i>q</i>, steering S. E. and S. W. have the wind six points large,
or more properly on the quarter; which is considered as the most favourable
manner of sailing, because all the sails co-operate to increase the ship’s velocity:
whereas, when the wind is right aft, as in the ship <i>m</i>, it is evident, that the
wind, in its passage to the foremost sails, will be intercepted by those which
are farther aft. When the wind is on the quarter, the fore-tack is brought to
the cat-head; and the main-tack being cast off, the weather-clue of the mainsail
is hoisted up to the yard, in order to let the wind pass freely to the foresail;
and the yards are disposed so as to make an angle of about two points,
or nearly 22°, with the keel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ships <i>i</i> and <i>p</i>, of which the former sails S. E. <i>b</i> S. and the latter S. W,
<i>b</i> S. are said to have the wind three points on the larboard or starboard quarter:
and those expressed by <i>k</i> and <i>o</i>, two points; as steering S. S. E. and S. S.
W. in both which positions the yards make nearly an angle of 16°, or about
a point and an half, with the ship’s length.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the wind is one point on the quarter, as in the ships <i>l</i> and <i>n</i>, whose
courses are S. <i>b</i> E. and S. <i>b</i> W. the situation of the yards and sails is very
little different from the last mentioned; the angle which they make with the
keel being somewhat less than a point, and the stay-sails being rendered of
very little service. The ship <i>m</i> sails right afore the wind, or with the wind
right aft. In this position the yards are laid at right angles with the ship’s
length: the stay-sails, being entirely useless, are hauled down: and the mainsail
is drawn up in the brails, that the fore-sail may operate: a measure which
considerably facilitates the steerage, or effort of the helm. As the wind is
then intercepted, by the main top-sail and main top-gallant-sail, in its passage
to the fore top-sail and fore top-gallant-sail, these latter are by consequence
entirely <i>becalmed</i>, and might therefore be furled, to prevent their being fretted
by flapping against the mast, but that their effort contributes greatly to
prevent the ship from <i>broaching-to</i>, when she deviates from her course to the
right or left thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus all the different methods of sailing may be divided into four, viz.
close hauled, large, quartering, and afore the wind; all which relate to the
direction of the wind with regard to the ship’s course, and the arrangement
of the sails. See also <i>Drift</i> and <i>Leeway</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Order of</i> <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>, the general disposition of a fleet of ships when proceeding
on a voyage or expedition.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been observed in the article <span class='sc'>Fleet</span>, that the most convenient
order of sailing, for a squadron of ships, is in three parallel columns, so as to
form the line of battle with greater facility and expedition. In this disposition,
the station of each ship is previously appointed by the commander in chief;
and the ranks or columns are as near to each other as regularity, and a
regard for their common security, will admit. This distance, which ought
to be carefully observed in tacking, may be regulated by the movements of
some of the ships in the column farthest to windward, which should accordingly
govern the operations of the whole squadron. See <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sailing</span> also implies a particular mode of navigation, formed on the principles,
and regulated by the laws of trigonometry. Hence we say, plain
sailing, mercator’s, middle-latitude, parallel and great circle sailing. See
the article <span class='sc'>Navigation</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SAILOR, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matelot</span></i>, a seafaring man: a person trained in the exercise of
fixing the machinery of a ship, and managing her, either at sea, or in a road,
or harbour.</p>

<p class='c008'>SAIL-YARD. See the article <span class='sc'>Yard</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SALVAGE, a third part of the value of anything recovered from the enemy,
after having remained in his possession twenty-four hours; or of any thing
dragged up from the bottom of the sea. It is paid by the first proprietors to
the persons who have so recovered it, or else detained legally by the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>SALUTE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salut</span></i>, (from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">saluto</span></i>, Lat.) a testimony of deference or homage
rendered by the ships of one nation to another; or by ships of the same nation
to a superior or equal.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ceremony is variously performed, according to the circumstances,
rank, or situation of the parties. It consists in firing a certain number of
cannon, or vollies of small arms; of striking the colours or top-sails; or of
one or more general shouts of the whole ship’s crew, mounted on the masts or
rigging for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal regulations with regard to salutes in the royal navy are as
follow.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When a flag-officer salutes the admiral and commander in chief of the
fleet, he is to give him fifteen guns; but when captains salute him, they are
to give him seventeen guns. The admiral or commander in chief of the
fleet is to return two guns less to flag-officers, and four less to captains.
Flag-officers saluting their superior or senior officer, are to give him thirteen
guns. Flag-officers are to return an equal number of guns to flag-officers
bearing their flags on the same mast, and two guns less to the rest, as also to
captains.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When a captain salutes an admiral of the white or blue, he is to give him
fifteen guns; but to vice and rear admirals, thirteen guns. When a flag-officer
is saluted by two or more of his Majesty’s ships, he is not to return the
salute till all have finished, and then to do it with such a reasonable number of
guns as he shall judge proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘In case of the meeting of two squadrons, the two chiefs only are to exchange
salutes. And if single ships meet a squadron consisting of more than
one flag, the principal flag only is to be saluted. No salutes shall be repeated
by the same ships, unless there has been a separation of six months at least.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘None of his Majesty’s ships of war, commanded only by captains, shall
give or receive salutes from one another, in whatsoever part of the world
they meet.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘A flag-officer commanding in chief shall be saluted, upon his first hoisting
of his flag, by all the ships present, with such a number of guns as is allowed
by the first, third, or fifth articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When any of his Majesty’s ships shall meet with any ship or ships belonging
to any foreign prince or state, within his Majesty’s seas, (which extend to
Cape Finisterre) it is expected, that the said foreign ships do strike their
top-sail, and take in their flag, in acknowledgment of his Majesty’s sovereignty
in those seas: and if any shall refuse or offer to resist, it is enjoined to all
flag-officers and commanders to use their utmost endeavours to compel them
thereto, and not suffer any dishonour to be done to his Majesty. And if any
of his Majesty’s subjects shall so much forget their duty, as to omit striking
their top-sail in passing by his Majesty’s ships, the name of the ship and master,
and from whence, and whither bound, together with affidavits of the
fact, are to be sent up to the secretary of the admiralty, in order to their being
proceeded against in the admiralty-court. And it is to be observed, that
in his Majesty’s seas, his Majesty’s ships are in no wise to strike to any; and
that in other parts, no ship of his Majesty’s is to strike her flag or topsail to
any foreigner, unless such foreign ship shall have first struck, or at the same
time strike her flag or top-sail to his Majesty’s ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The flag-officers and commanders of his Majesty’s ships are to be careful
to maintain his Majesty’s honour upon all occasions, giving protection to his
subjects, and endeavouring, what in them lies, to secure and encourage them
in their lawful commerce; and they are not to injure, in any manner, the
subjects of his Majesty’s friends and allies.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘If a foreign admiral meets with any of his Majesty’s ships, and salutes
them, he shall receive gun for gun. If he be a vice-admiral, the admiral
shall answer with two guns less. If a rear-admiral, the admiral and vice-admiral
shall return two less. But if the ship be commanded by a captain only,
the flag-officers shall give two guns less, and captains an equal number.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When any of his Majesty’s ships come to an anchor in a foreign port or
road, within cannon-shot of its forts, the captain may salute the place with
such a number of guns as have been customary, upon good assurance of having
the like number returned, but not otherwise. But if the ship bears a flag,
the flag-officer shall first carefully inform himself how flags of like rank, belonging
to other crowned heads, have given or returned salutes, and to insist
upon the same terms of respect.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘It is allowed to the commanders of his Majesty’s ships in foreign parts, to
salute the persons of any admirals, commanders in chief, or captains of ships
of war of foreign nations, and foreign noblemen or strangers of quality, as
also the factories of the king’s subjects, coming on board to visit the ship;
and the number of guns is left to the commander, as shall be suitable to the
occasion, and the quality of the persons visiting; but he is nevertheless to
remain accountable for any excesses in the abuse of this liberty. If the ship
visited be in company with other ships of war, the captain is not to make use
of the civilities allowed in the preceding article, but with leave and consent
of the commander in chief, or the senior captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Merchant-ships, whether foreigners, or belonging to his Majesty’s subjects,
saluting the admiral of the fleet, shall be answered by six guns less; when they
salute any other flag-ships, they shall be answered by four guns less; and if
they salute men of war commanded by captains, they shall be answered by
two guns less. If several merchant-ships salute in company, no return is to
be made, till all have finished, and then by such a number of guns as shall
be thought proper; but though the merchant-ships should answer, there shall
be no second return.——</p>

<p class='c008'>SAMSONS-POST, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piedroit</span></i>, a sort of pillar erected in a ship’s hold, between
the lower deck and the <i>kelson</i>, under the edge of a hatchway, and furnished
with several notches that serve as steps to mount or descend, as occasion
requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>This post being firmly driven into its place, not only serves to support the
beam, and fortify the vessel in that place, but also to prevent the cargo or
materials contained in the hold from shifting to the opposite side, by the rolling
of the ship in a turbulent and heavy sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>SAUCER. See the article <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCALING <i>the guns</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soufler</span></i>, the act of cleaning the inside of a ship’s cannon,
by the explosion of a small quantity of powder; which effectually blows
out any dirt or scales of iron which may adhere to the interior surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCANTING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">addoner</span></i>, the variation of the wind by which it becomes unfavourable
to a ship’s course, after having been <i>fair</i> or <i>large</i>. It is distinguished
from a foul wind, as in the former, a ship is still enabled to sail on her
course, although her progress is considerably retarded; but in the latter
she is obliged to deviate from the line of her course, as explained in the article
<span class='sc'>Tacking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCANTLING, the dimensions of any piece of timber with regard to its
breadth and thickness.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCARF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empature</span></i>, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">scherven</span></i>, Dutch) a particular method of uniting two
pieces of timber together by the extremities.</p>

<p class='c008'>When two pieces of timber are joined together, so that the end of one goes
over the end of the other, being tapered so that the one may be let into the
other, and become even, they are said to be scarfed: such are the keel-pieces.
But when the ends of the two pieces are cut square, and put together, they
are said to <i>butt</i> to one another; and when another piece is laid upon, and
fastened to both, as is the case in all the frame-timbers, this is called scarfing
the timbers; and half the piece which fastens the two timbers together is reckoned
the length of the scarf. <cite>Murray’s Ship-building.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>SCHOONER, a small vessel with two masts, whose main-sail and fore-sail
are suspended from <i>gaffs</i> reaching from the mast towards the stern; and
stretched out below by booms, whose foremost ends are hooked to an iron,
which clasps the mast so as to turn therein as upon an axis, when the after
ends are swung from one side of the vessel to the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCOOP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écoupe</span></i>, a little hollowed piece of wood, employed to throw water
out of a boat into the sea, which is usually called bailing the boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCRAPING, the act of shaving off the dirty surface of the plank, in a ship’s
side or decks, particularly after a voyage, or when the <i>seams</i> have been covered
with a new composition of melted pitch or rosin. The instrument with
which this is performed is accordingly called a scraper, and is represented in
fig. 4. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the sides of a ship are sufficiently scraped, they are varnished over
with turpentine, or a mixture of tar and oil, or such materials; which preserves
the planks from being rent or split by the sun and wind, and gives the
ship a more gay and spendid appearance on the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCUDDING, (<i><span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Skutta</span></i>, Swedish) the movement by which a ship is carried
precipitately before a tempest.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a ship flies with amazing rapidity through the water, whenever this expedient
is put in practice, it is never attempted in a contrary wind, unless when
her condition renders her incapable of sustaining the mutual effort of the wind
and waves any longer on her side, without being exposed to the most imminent
danger. See the article <span class='sc'>Trying</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship either scuds with a sail extended on her fore mast, or, if the storm
is excessive, without any sail, which in the sea-phrase is called scudding under
<i>bare poles</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aller à sec</span></i>. In sloops and schooners, and other small vessels,
the sail employed for this purpose is called the square-sail, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voile de fortune</span></i>.
In large ships, it is either the foresail, at large, <i>reefed</i>, or with its <i>goose-wings</i>
extended, according to the degree of the tempest; or it is the fore top-sail
close-reefed, and lowered on the <i>cap</i>: which last is particularly used when the
sea runs so high as to <i>becalm</i> the foresail occasionally; a circumstance which
exposes the ship to the danger of <i>broaching-to</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal hazards incident to scudding are generally, a <i>pooping</i> sea; the
difficulty of steering, which exposes the vessel perpetually to the risk of broaching-to;
and the want of sufficient sea-room. A sea striking the ship violently
on the stern may dash it inwards, by which she must inevitably <i>founder</i>. In
broaching-to suddenly, she is threatened with being immediately overturned;
and, for want of sea-room, she is endangered by shipwreck on a lee-shore;
a circumstance too dreadful to require explanation!</p>

<p class='c008'>SCUPPERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dalots</span></i>, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">schoepen</span></i>, Dutch, <i>to draw off</i>) certain channels cut
through the water-ways and sides of a ship, at proper distances, and lined
with plated lead, in order to carry the water off from the deck into the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scuppers of the lower deck of a ship of war are usually furnished with
a leathern pipe, called the scupper-hoase, which hangs downward from the
mouth or opening of the scupper. The intent of this is to prevent the water
from entering when the ship inclines under a weight of sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCUTTLE, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écoutille</span></i>, Fr.) a small hatchway cut for some particular purpose
through a ship’s deck, or through the coverings of her hatchways, and
being furnished with a lid which firmly encloses it whenever necessary. See
<span class='sc'>Deck</span> and <span class='sc'>Hatchway</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SCUTTLING, the act of cutting large holes through the bottom or sides
of a ship, either when she is <i>stranded</i> or overset, and continues to float on the
surface. The design of this expedient is usually to take out the whole or a
part of the cargo, provisions, stores, &amp;c. with all possible expedition.</p>

<p class='c008'>SEA, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mer</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sæ</span></i>, Sax. <i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">zee</span></i>, Dutch) is known to be a great congregation of
waters, which is either universal or local; as surrounding the whole earth, or
flowing on the coast of some particular country.</p>

<p class='c008'>This term, however, is variously applied by sailors, to a single wave; to
the agitation produced by a multitude of waves in a tempest; or to their particular
progress or direction. Thus they say, a heavy sea broke over our
<i>quarter</i>, or we <i>shipped</i> a heavy sea; there is a great sea in the <i>offing</i>; the sea
sets to the southward. Hence a ship is said to head the sea, when her course
is opposed to the <i>setting</i> or direction of the surges.</p>

<p class='c008'>A long sea implies an uniform and steddy motion of long and extensive
waves; on the contrary, a short sea is when they run irregularly, broken,
and interrupted; so as frequently to burst over a vessel’s side or
quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sea-Boat</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vaisseau beau de mer</span></i>, a vessel that bears the sea firmly, without
labouring heavily, or straining her masts and rigging.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sea-Coast</span>, the shore of any country; or that part which is washed by the
sea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sea-Faring</span>, the occupation of a mariner or sailor.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Seaman</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">homme de mer</span></i>, a mariner or person trained in the exercise of fixing
the machinery of a ship, and applying it to the purposes of navigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal articles required in a common sailor to intitle him to the full
wages, are, that he can steer, sound, and manage the sails, by extending,
<i>reefing</i>, and furling them, as occasion requires. When he is expert at these
exercises, his skill in all other matters relative to his employment is taken for
granted.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sea-Mark</span>, a point or conspicuous place distinguished at sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sea-marks are of various kinds, as steeples, promontories, piles of ruins,
groupes of trees, &amp;c. and are very necessary to direct vessels on the coast of
their situation. See also <span class='sc'>Beacon</span> and <span class='sc'>Buoy</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sea-Room</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle derive</span></i>, implies a sufficient distance from the coast, as well
as from any rocks or shallows, whereby a ship may drive or scud without
danger of shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sea-Weeds</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sarts</span></i>, a sort of herbs or tangles floating on the surface of the
sea, or washed upon the sea-coast. See the French term <span class='sc'>Mer</span>, and the phrases
which follow in order.</p>

<p class='c008'>SEAMS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coutures</span></i>, the intervals between the edges of the planks in the
decks and sides of a ship; or the places where the planks join together.
These are always filled with a quantity of <i>oakum</i>, and covered with hot pitch,
to prevent the entrance of the water. See the article <span class='sc'>Calking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SEIZING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amarrer</span></i>, the operation of fastening any two ropes, or different
parts of one rope together, with a small line or cord: also the cord (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ammarage</span></i>)
which fastens them.</p>

<p class='c008'>SELVAGEE, a sort of hank or skein of rope-yarn tied together at several
distances. It is used to fasten round any rope, as a shroud or stay, so that a
tackle may be hooked in it, to extend the said shroud or stay, which is called
setting it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>SENDING, the act of pitching precipitately into the hollow or interval,
between two waves.</p>

<p class='c008'>SENNIT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garcettes</span></i>, (from <i>seven</i> and <i>knit</i>) a sort of flat braided cordage,
formed by platting five or seven rope-yarns together.</p>

<p class='c008'>SERVING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrer</span></i>, winding any thing round a rope, to prevent it from
being rubbed. The materials used for this purpose, and which are accordingly
called <i>service</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrure</span></i>, are generally small lines, leather, <i>plat</i> canvas, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SETTEE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">scitie</span></i>, a ship of two masts, equipped with triangular sails, commonly
called lateen sails. These vessels are peculiar to the Mediterranean
sea, and are generally navigated by Italians, Greeks, or Mahometans.</p>

<p class='c008'>SETTING, the act of observing the situation of any distant object by the
compass, in order to discover the angle which it makes with the nearest meridian;
as, at seven in the evening, we set the Tower of Arabia near the port
of Alexandria, and it bore S. S. E. distant four leagues by estimation. See
<span class='sc'>Bearing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Setting</span> also denotes the direction of the wind, current, or sea, but particularly
the two latter: as, the tide which sets to the south, is opposed to a
swelling sea setting to the north-west.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Setting</span>, when applied to the sails, is the loosening and expanding them,
so as to move a ship along the water, after she had been for some time at rest;
or to accelerate her velocity when she is already moving, and perhaps give a
new direction to her motion. It is used in contradistinction to taking-in the
sails, as loosing or heaving-out is opposed to furling or stowing them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Setting-up</span>, the act of extending the <i>shrouds</i>, <i>stays</i>, and <i>back-stays</i>, to secure
the masts, by the application of mechanical powers, as tackles, &amp;c. See
<span class='sc'>Dead-eye</span>, <span class='sc'>Laniard</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SETTLED, lowered in the water; as, we have settled the land, or sunk
it lower, by sailing farther out to seaward. This phrase is usually opposed to
raising; the former being occasioned by departing from the object understood,
and the latter by approaching it: however, the sense is more commonly
expressed <i>laying</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SEWED, the situation of a ship which rests upon the ground till the depth
of water sufficient to float her is diminished by the reflux of the tide. Thus
if a ship runs aground on the tide of ebb, and it be required to know if she has
sewed, the water-line or mark on her side, stem, or stern-post, where the surface
of the water reaches when she is afloat, is examined, and this mark being
found above the water, she is said to be sewed by as much as is the
difference.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHAKES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ébaroui</span></i>, a name given by shipwrights to the cracks or rents in
a plank, occasioned by the sun or weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHANK, the beam or shaft of an <i>anchor</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Shank-Painter</span>, a short rope and chain which hangs the shank and flukes
of the anchor up to the ship’s side, as the <i>stopper</i> fastens the ring and stock
to the cathead.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> SHAPE <i>the course</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commander à la route</span></i>, to direct or appoint the track
of a ship, in order to prosecute a voyage.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHARP. See <span class='sc'>Bottom</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHEATHING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doublage</span></i>, a sort of casing or covering laid on the outside
of a ship’s bottom, to protect the planks from the pernicious effects of the
worms: particularly in hot climates, as between the tropics.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sheathing either consists of a number of boards or deals of fir, or of sheets
of lead or copper; which last is a very late invention, having been only experienced
on a few of his Majesty’s frigates: it seems, however, to answer the
purpose much better than the fir-planks. When the sheathing is performed
with boards, there is a quantity of hair and tar inserted between the outside of
the bottom and the inner surface of the boards.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHEAVE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouet</span></i>, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">schijf</span></i>, Dutch) a solid cylindrical wheel, fixed in a channel,
and moveable about an axis, as being used to raise or increase the mechanical
powers applied to remove any body.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sheaves are either fixed in blocks, or in channels cut through the
masts, caps, cat-heads, or sides of a ship. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHEEP-SHANK: a sort of knot or hitch cast on a rope, to shorten it as
occasion requires: particularly to increase the sweep or length of a tackle by
contracting its <i>runner</i>. By this contrivance the body to which the tackle is
applied may be hoisted much higher, or removed much farther, in a shorter
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus if any weighty body is to be hoisted into a ship, and it be found that
the blocks of the tackle meet before the object can reach the top of the side,
it will be necessary to lower it again, or hang it by some other method, till the
<i>runner</i> of the tackle is sheep-shanked, by which the blocks will again be separated
to a competent distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHEER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">relevement</span></i>, the longitudinal curve of a ship’s deck or sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHEERING, in navigation, the act of deviating or straying from the line
of the course, either to the right or left, so as to form a crooked and irregular
path through the water. It is commonly occasioned by the ship’s being difficult
to steer, but very often from the negligence or incapacity of the helmsman.
Hence, to <i>sheer off</i> is to remove at a greater distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHEERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">machine à mater</span></i>, an engine used to hoist-in or displace the lower
masts of a ship. See the article <span class='sc'>Mast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sheers employed for this purpose in the royal navy are described under
the article <i>hulk</i>. In merchant-ships this machine is composed of two masts or
props, erected in the same vessel wherein the mast is to be planted, or from
whence it is to be removed. The lower ends of these props rest on the opposite
sides of the deck, and their upper parts are fastened across, so as that a
<i>tackle</i>, which depends from the intersection, may be almost perpendicularly
above the station of the mast, to which the mechanical powers are applied.
These sort of sheers are secured by stays, which extend forward and aft to the
opposite extremities of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHEET, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écoute</span></i>, a rope fastened to one or both the lower corners of a sail,
to extend and retain it in a particular station. See <span class='sc'>Clue</span> and <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship sails with a lateral wind, the lower corner of the main and
fore sail are fastened by a tack and a sheet; the former being to windward
and the latter to leeward: the tack, however, is entirely disused with a stern-wind;
whereas the sail is never spread without the assistance of one or both of
the sheets.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stay-sails and studding-sails have only one tack and one sheet each:
the stay-sail-tacks are always fastened forward, and the sheet drawn <i>aft</i>;
but the studding-sail-tack draws the outer clue of the sail to the extremity
of the boom; whereas the sheet is employed, to extend the inmost.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To haul home the</i> <span class='sc'>Sheet</span>. See <span class='sc'>Home</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sheet-anchor</span>. See the article <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHELL, in artillery. See <span class='sc'>Mortar</span> and <span class='sc'>Range</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Shell</span> <i>of a block</i>, the outer frame or case, wherein the <i>sheave</i> or wheel is
contained, and traverses about its axis. See <span class='sc'>Block</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHELVES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écueils</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">schylf</span></i>, Sax.) a general name given to any dangerous
shallows, sand-banks, or rocks lying immediately under the surface of the water,
so as to intercept any ship in her passage, and expose her to destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHIFTED, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">desarrimée</span></i>, the state of a ship’s ballast or cargo when it is shaken
from one side to the other, either by the violence of her <i>rolling</i> in a turbulent
sea, or by an extraordinary inclination to one side when under a great
pressure of sail. This circumstance, however, rarely happens, unless to those
cargoes which are stowed in <i>bulk</i>, as corn, salt, or such materials. See <span class='sc'>Laden</span>
and <span class='sc'>Trim</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Shifted</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauté</span></i>, when expressed of the wind, implies altered.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHIFTER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">detrempeur</span></i>, a person appointed to assist the ship’s cook, particularly
in washing, steeping, and shifting the salt provisions.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHIFTING <i>a tackle</i>, the act of removing the blocks of a tackle to a
greater distance from each other, on the object to which they are applied, in
order to give a greater scope or extent to their purchase. This operation is
otherwise called fleeting. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Shifting</span> <i>the helm</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontrer</span></i>, is the alteration of its position, by pushing
it towards the opposite side of the ship. See <span class='sc'>Helm</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Shifting</span> <i>the voyal</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depasser</span></i>, changing its position on the capstern from
the right to the left, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHIP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vaisseau</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scip</span></i>, Sax.) a general name given by seamen to the first
rank of vessels which are navigated on the ocean.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst people who are unacquainted with marine distinctions, this term
is of very vague and indiscriminate acceptation: and indeed sailors themselves,
submitting occasionally to the influence of custom, receive it according to
this general idea. In the sea-language, however, it is more particularly applied
to a vessel furnished with three masts, each of which is composed of a
lower mast, top-mast, and top-gallant-mast, with the usual machinery thereto
belonging.</p>

<p class='c008'>The design of this work being professedly to treat of the construction,
mechanism, furniture, movements, and military operations of a ship, we
may properly consider the present article as a general recapitulation of the
whole subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plans, elevations, and sections used in the construction of a ship; the
principal pieces of which she is composed, and the qualities requisite to answer
the several purposes of navigation, are described, or referred to, in
<i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>: and the application of this theory to practice is
treated in the article <i>Ship</i>-<span class='fss'>BUILDING</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The machinery and furniture with which she is equipped are variously diffused
throughout this work, and naturally spring from one another, like a
multitude of branches from one general trunk. See <span class='sc'>Mast</span>, <span class='sc'>Sail</span>, <span class='sc'>Yard</span>,
<span class='sc'>Rigging</span>, <span class='sc'>Anchor</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The qualities by which she is enabled to encounter a tempestuous sea are
treated in the article <span class='sc'>Ballast</span> and <span class='sc'>Trim</span>; and her several movements therein
are explained under <span class='sc'>Navigation</span>, <span class='sc'>Drift</span>, <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>, <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>, <span class='sc'>Leeway</span>,
<span class='sc'>Pitching</span>, and <span class='sc'>Rolling</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Considered as a moveable fortress or citadel, her military operations are copiously
described in <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>, <span class='sc'>Cannonade</span>, <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>, <span class='sc'>Line</span>, and <span class='sc'>Range</span>;
and as her efforts are occasionally like those of a mine, or bombardment, the
reader is also referred to the articles <span class='sc'>Fire-ship</span> and <span class='sc'>Mortar</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vessels which are usually comprehended under the general name of
ship, besides those of the line of battle, are galleons, frigates, hag-boats, cats,
barks, pinks, and fly-boats; all of which are defined in their proper places,
except the hag-boat, that only differs from a frigate-built ship in the figure
of the stern, which has a great resemblance to that of the <i>cat</i>, as being in a
middle degree between the former and the latter. See also the article <span class='sc'>Quarter</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ships of war are properly equipped with artillery, ammunition, and all
the necessary martial weapons and instruments for attack or defence. They
are distinguished from each other by their several ranks or classes. See
<span class='sc'>Rate</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ship</span> <i>of the line</i> is usually applied to all men of war mounting sixty guns
and upwards. Of late, however, our fifty-gun ships have been formed sufficiently
strong to carry the same metal as those of sixty, and accordingly may
fall into the line in cases of necessity. See <span class='sc'>Line</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ships of seventy-four cannon, and thereabouts, are generally esteemed
the most useful in the line of battle, and indeed in almost every other purpose
of war. It has therefore been judged conformable to our design, to represent
different views and sections of a ship of this class. Thus plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>.
exhibits the head, together with the <i>bow</i> or fore part. Plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>. shews a
transverse section through the broadest part, with the profile of her upper and
lower deck batteries. Plate <a href='#III'>III</a>. contains an horizontal section at the lower
deck, together with the plan of the battery planted on one side thereof, and
all the pieces by which the deck is supported on the other. The quarter,
and all the after part of the ship, is exhibited in plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. and the elevation
of the stern in plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. all of which are on the same scale, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> one fourth of
an inch to a foot, except the deck, which is one eighth of an inch to a foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have also, on a smaller scale, expressed an elevation or side-view of a
sixty-gun ship, in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. with the head thereof in plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. fig. 11. and the
stern in plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. fig. 2. both of which are viewed upon a line on the continuation
of the keel.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Armed</i> <span class='sc'>Ship</span>. See <span class='sc'>Armed Ship</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Hospital</i>-<span class='sc'>Ship</span>, a vessel fitted up to attend on a fleet of men of war, and receive
their sick or wounded; for which purpose her decks should be high,
and her ports sufficiently large. Her cables ought also to run upon the upper
deck, to the end that the beds or cradles may be more commodiously placed
between decks, and admit a free passage of the air, to disperse that which is
offensive or corrupted.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Leeward</i> <span class='sc'>Ship</span>. See <span class='sc'>Leeward</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Merchant</i>-<span class='sc'>Ship</span>, a vessel employed in commerce, to carry commodities of
various sorts from one port to another.</p>

<p class='c008'>The largest merchant-ships are those employed by the different European
companies of merchants who trade to the East Indies. They are in general
somewhat larger than our forty-gun ships: they are mounted with twenty
cannon on their upper deck, which are nine pounders, and six on their quarter-deck,
which are six pounders. Plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. fig. 5. represents a view of one of these
vessels on the larboard bow, where <i>a</i> is the ensign-staff, A the mizen-mast,
B the main-mast, C the fore-mast, K the <i>poop</i>, L L an awning of wood extending
across the after part of the quarter-deck, M poop-ladder, N O steps
of the gangway, P head of the capstern on the quarter-deck, Q R the skeeds
on the gangway, <i>r</i> the belfry on the forecastle, <i>s</i> the timber-heads, <i>y</i> the cut-water,
with a lion-head fixed upon it. The other parts of this ship represented
in the figure are referred to from the explanations of the head, plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>.
and the quarter in plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 6. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. exhibits a quarter view of a foreign-built East-Indiaman,
with a <i>square tuck</i>, or perpendicular counter, and having three poop-lanthorns
fixed on her <i>taffarel</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Store</i>-<span class='sc'>Ship</span>, a vessel employed to carry artillery or naval stores for the use of
a fleet, fortress, or garrison.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Transport</i>-<span class='sc'>Ship</span> is generally used to conduct troops from one place to another.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Weatherly</i>-<span class='sc'>Ship</span>. See <span class='sc'>Weatherly Ship</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the different kinds of ships, referred to above, and distinguished from
each other by their size or figure, we have only considered those which are
most common in European nations, where the marine art has received the
greatest improvements. So far is apparently consistent with the views of utility.
To give a circumstantial account of the various species of ships employed
in different nations, besides being an almost endless task, would be of little
service, except to gratify an useless curiosity. See <span class='sc'>Vessel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Ship</span>, is either used actively, as, to embark any person, or put any thing
aboard-ship; or passively, to receive any thing into a ship; as, we shipped a
heavy sea at three o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Ship</span>, also implies to fix any thing in its place; as, to ship the oars, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>
to fix them in their row-locks. To ship the swivel-guns, is to fix them in their
sockets, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ship-Shape</span>, according to the fashion of a ship, or in the manner of an expert
sailor; as, the mast is not rigged ship-shape; trim your sails ship-shape.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHIPPING, a multitude of vessels. The harbour is crouded with shipping.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHOAL, a term synonimous with <i>shallow</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHOE <i>of the anchor</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soulier</span></i>, a small block of wood, convex on the back, and
having a small hole, sufficient to contain the point of the anchor-fluke, on the
fore side. It is used to prevent the anchor from tearing or wounding the
planks on the ship’s <i>bow</i>, when ascending or descending; for which purpose
the shoe slides up and down along the bow, between the fluke of the anchor
and the planks, as being press’d close to the latter by the weight of the
former.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Shoe</span> <i>an anchor</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brider</span></i>, is to cover the flukes with a broad triangular
piece of plank, whose area or superficies is much larger than that of the
flukes. It is intended to give the anchor a stronger and surer hold of the bottom
in very soft and oozy ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHORE, a general name for the sea-coast of any country.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Shore</span> is also a prop or large <i>stanchion</i> fixed under a ship’s sides or bottom,
to support her when laid aground or on the stocks, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bold</i> <span class='sc'>Shore</span>, a coast which is steep and abrupt, so as to admit the closest
approach of shipping without exposing them to the danger of being stranded.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> SHORTEN, expressed of a ship’s sails, is used in opposition to <i>make</i>.
See that article, as also <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHOT, a missive weapon, discharged by the force of inflamed powder
from a fire-arm in battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shot used in the sea-service is of various kinds, as bullets, bar-shot,
chain-shot, case-shot, and grape-shot; all of which are used in the royal navy.
There is besides other shot, of a more pernicious kind, used by privateers,
and other piratical rovers: such are <i>langrage</i> star-shot, fire-arrows, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first and most simple is the round-shot, which is a ball or globe of iron,
whose weight is in proportion to the size of the cannon, or to the diameter of
its bore.</p>

<p class='c008'>The double-headed, or bar-shot, fig. 11. plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>. are balls cut into two
equal parts, and joined together by a kind of iron bar. In the French service
the middle is sometimes filled with a composition, and the whole covered
with linen dipped in brimstone; the cannon in firing also inflames the combustibles
or composition of this ball, which sets fire to the sails of the vessel.
One of the heads of this ball has an hole to receive a fuse, which, communicating
with the charge of the cannon, sets fire to the bullet<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chain-shot, fig. 12. consists of two balls chained together, being
principally designed to destroy the masts and rigging, which they are better
fitted to perform than the single bullets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grape-shot is a combination of balls, fig. 13. put into a thick canvas bag,
and corded strongly together, so as to form a sort of cylinder, whose diameter is
equal to that of the ball which is adapted to the cannon. This shot is represented
by fig. 13. on a larger scale, at the bottom of the plate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Case-shot, fig. 14. is formed by putting a great quantity of musket-bullets
into a cylindrical tin-box called a canister. They are principally used by the
French to scour the decks of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fire-arrows</i> are described in the notes under the article <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>, and
<i>Langrage</i> under that word.</p>

<p class='c008'>Star-shot consists of four pieces of iron, whose bases, when separate, form the
quadrant of a circle; so that the whole being joined, forms a cylinder equal to
the shot of the cannon. Each of those pieces is furnished with an iron bar, the
extremity of which is attached to a sort of link, as keys are strung upon a ring.
Being discharged from the gun, the four branches or arms extend every way
from the link in the center. These also are chiefly intended to destroy the sails
or rigging, but their flight and execution is very precarious at any tolerable
distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>SHROUDS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haubans</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scrud</span></i>, Sax.) a range of large ropes extended from
the mast-heads to the right and left side of the ship, to support the masts, and
enable them to carry sail, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shrouds are always divided into pairs or couples: that is to say, one
piece of rope is doubled, fig. 7. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. and the two parts fastened together
at a small distance from the middle <i>a</i>, so as to leave a sort of noose or
collars <i>a b</i> to fix upon the mast-head. This collar being fixed in its place,
viz. close down upon the <i>tressel-trees k</i> fig. 2. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. a pair of shrouds depend
from it, whose lower ends ought to reach down to the deck. The lower
ends of these shrouds are <i>set up</i> or extended to the <i>channel</i> I. fig. 2. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>.
on the outside of the ship, by the application of mechanical powers, as explained
in the articles <i>dead-eye</i> and <i>laniard</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shrouds as well as the sails are denominated from the masts to which
they belong. Thus they are the main, fore, and mizen shrouds, the main
top-mast, fore top-mast, or mizen top-mast shrouds, and the main top-gallant,
fore top-gallant, or mizen top-gallant shrouds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of shrouds by which a mast is sustained, as well as the size of
rope of which they are formed, is always in proportion to the size of the mast,
and the weight of sail it is intended to carry.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two foremost shrouds on the starboard and larboard side of the ship are
always fitted first upon the mast-head; and then the second on the starboard
and the second on the larboard, and so on till the whole number is fixed.
The intention of this arrangement is to <i>brace</i> the <i>yards</i> with greater facility
when the sails are close-hauled, which could not be performed without great
difficulty if the foremost shrouds were last fitted on the mast-head, because
the angle which they would make with the mast would then be greatly increased.
See also <i>Swifter</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The topmast-shrouds are extended from the topmast-heads to the edges of
the tops, as expressed by fig. 3, pl. VI. and fig. 1. pl. IX. The lower dead-eye <i>q</i>,
employed for this purpose, is fitted with an iron band, called the foot-hook plate,
which passes thro’ a hole in the edge of the top, and communicates with
a rope called the foot-hook shroud, whose lower end is attached to the shrouds
of the lower mast, in the station <i>l</i>. The upper ends of the foot-hook shrouds
are furnished with an iron hook <i>n</i>, which enters a hole in the lower end of the
foot-hook plate, so that when the top-mast shrouds are extended to secure the
mast, the foot-hook shrouds necessarily acquire an equal tension by means of
the foot-hook plate, which, passing through the top, transmits the effort of
the mechanical powers, to the foot-hook shrouds below.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shrouds of the top-gallant masts are extended to the cross-trees, as represented
by <i>m</i>, fig. 1. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. See also fig. 5. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SIDE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coté</span></i>, a name given to the flanks of a ship, or in general to all
that part which is presented to the view between the <i>stem</i> and <i>stern</i>, in a direction
nearly perpendicular to the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The figure of the side is formed by that of the timbers upon which it is
constructed. It is covered with planks, extending from one end of the ship to
the other; it is also reinforced in different places by <i>beams</i>, <i>clamps</i>, <i>knees</i>, <i>riders</i>,
and <i>standards</i>. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The side is terminated above by the gunnel, and below by the lower edge
of the main wale, which separates it from the bottom: it is inclosed by the
stern abaft, and by the bow forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>SIGNALS, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">signal</span></i>, Fr.) certain alarms or notices used to communicate
intelligence to a distant object at sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Signals are made by firing artillery, and displaying colours, lanthorns, or
fire-works: and these are combined by multiplication and repetition. Thus,
like the words of a language, they become arbitrary expressions, to which
we have previously annexed particular ideas: and hence they are the general
sources of intelligence throughout a naval armament, &amp;c. See <span class='sc'>Admiral</span>
and <span class='sc'>Engagement</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Signals ought to be distinct, with simplicity. They are simple, when every
instruction is expressed by a particular token, in order to avoid any mistakes
arising from the double purport of one signal. They are distinct, when
issued without precipitation; when sufficient time is allowed to observe and
obey them; and when they are exposed in a conspicuous place, so as to be readily
perceived at a distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>All signals may be reduced into three different kinds, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> Those which are
made by the sound of particular instruments, as the trumpet, horn, or fife;
to which may be added, striking the bell, or beating the drum. Those
which are made by displaying <i>pendants</i>, <i>ensigns</i>, and <i>flags</i> of different colours;
or by lowering or altering the position of the sails: And, finally, those which
are executed by rockets of different kinds; by firing cannon, or small arms;
by artificial fire-works; and by lanthorns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Firing of great guns will serve equally in the day or night, or in a fog; to
make or confirm signals; or to raise the attention of the hearers to a future order.
This method, however, is attended with some inconveniencies, and
should not be used indiscriminately. Too great a repetition of the cannon is
apt to introduce mistakes and confusion, as well as to discover the tract of the
squadron. The report and flight of the rockets is liable to the same objection,
when at a short distance from the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is then, by the combination of signals, previously known, that the admiral
conveys orders to his fleet; every <i>squadron</i>, every <i>division</i>, and every
ship of which has its particular signal. The instruction may therefore occasionally
be given to the whole fleet, or to any of its squadrons; to any division
of those squadrons, or to any ship of those divisions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence the signal of command may at the same time be displayed for three
divisions, and for three ships of each division; or for three ships in each squadron,
and for only nine ships in the whole fleet. For, the general signal of
the fleet being shewn, if a particular pendant be also thrown out from some
remarkable place on the same mast with the general signal, it will communicate
intelligence to nine ships that wear the same pendant.</p>

<p class='c008'>The preparatory signal given by the admiral to the whole, or any part of
his fleet, is immediately answered by those to whom it is directed; by shewing
the same signal, to testify that they are ready to put his orders in execution.
Having observed their answer, he will shew the signal which is to direct their
operations: as,</p>

<p class='c008'>To chace, to form the <i>line</i>, to begin the engagement, to board, to double
upon the enemy, to rally or return to action, to discontinue the fight, to retreat
and save themselves. The dexterity of <i>working</i> the ships in a fleet depends
on the precise moment of executing these orders; and on the general harmony
of their movements: a circumstance which evinces the utility of a signal
of preparation.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the extent of the line of battle, and the fire and smoke of the action,
or other circumstances in navigation, will frequently prevent the admiral’s
signals from being seen throughout the fleet, they are always repeated by the
officers next in command; by ships appointed to repeat signals; and, finally,
by the ship or ships for which they are intended.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ships that repeat the signals, besides the chiefs of squadrons or divisions,
are usually frigates lying to windward or to <i>leeward</i> of the line. They
should be extremely vigilant to observe and repeat the signals, whether they are
to transmit the orders of the commander in chief, or his seconds, to any part
of the fleet; or to report the fortunate or distressful situation of any part
thereof. By this means all the ships from the van to the rear will, unless disabled,
be ready at a moment’s warning to put the admiral’s designs in execution.</p>

<p class='c008'>To preserve order in the repetition of signals, and to favour their communication,
without embarassment, from the commander in chief, to the ship for
which they are calculated, the commanders of the squadrons repeat after the
admiral; the chiefs of the divisions, according to their order in the line, after
the commanders of the squadrons; and the particular ships after the chiefs
of the divisions; and those, in return, after the particular ships, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></i>, when
the object is to convey any intelligence from the latter to the admiral.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the signals above mentioned, there are others for different ranks of
officers; as for captains, lieutenants, masters, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">&amp;c.</span></i> or for any of those officers
of a peculiar ship. See <span class='sc'>Division</span> and <span class='sc'>Squadron</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SKEET, a sort of long scoop commonly used to wet the decks and sides of
a ship in hot weather, in order to keep them cool, and to prevent them from
splitting by the heat of the sun. This practice is accordingly performed in
general every morning and evening before sun-rise and after sun-set.</p>

<p class='c008'>This instrument, fig. 8. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. is also employed in small vessels to wet the
sails, to render them more steady and efficacious in light breezes.</p>

<p class='c008'>SKIDS, or SKEEDS, are long compassing pieces of timber, formed so as to
answer the vertical curve of a ship’s side. See Q, R, fig. 5. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. They
are notched below so as to fit closely upon the wales; and as they are intended
to preserve the planks of the side, when any weighty body is hoisted or lowered,
they extend from the main wale to the top of the side; and they are retained
in this position by bolts or spike-nails.</p>

<p class='c008'>SKIFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esquife</span></i> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scaffa</span></i>, Lat.) a small boat resembling a yawl. See the article
<span class='sc'>Boat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SLAB-LINE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cargue à vue</span></i>, a small cord passing up behind a ship’s mainsail
or fore-sail, and being <i>reeved</i> through a block, fig. 1. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. attached
to the lower part of the yard, is thence transmitted in two branches to the foot
of the sail, to which it is fastened. It is used to truss up the sail as occasion
requires; but more particularly for the conveniency of the pilot or steersman,
that they may look forward beneath it, as the ship advances.</p>

<p class='c008'>SLACK-WATER, the interval between the flux and reflux of the tide;
or between the last of the ebb and the first of the flood, during which the
current is interrupted; and the water apparently remains in a state of rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>SLATCH, is generally applied to the period of a transitory breeze of
wind, or the length of its duration.</p>

<p class='c008'>SLEEPERS, a name formerly given by shipwrights to the <i>thick-stuff</i> placed
longitudinally in a ship’s hold, opposite to the several <i>scarfs</i> of the timbers. It
is now properly applied to the knees, which connect the <i>transoms</i> to the after-timbers
on the ship’s <i>quarter</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SLINGS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elingue</span></i> (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">slingan</span></i>, Sax.) a rope whose ends are fixed in such a manner
to its other part, as to encircle a cask, bale, or case, and suspend it whilst
hoisting or lowering. Of these there are various sorts, according to the weight
or figure of the object to which they are applied. Those which are most frequently
used in lading and delivering ships are represented in fig. 9. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>.

<p class='c008'>SLIP, a place lying with a gradual descent on the banks of a river convenient
for ship-building.</p>

<p class='c008'>SLOOP, a small vessel furnished with one mast, the main-sail of which is
attached to a <i>gaff</i> above, to the mast on its foremost edge, and to a long boom
below; by which it is occasionally shifted to either quarter. See <span class='sc'>Vessel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sloop of War</span>, a name given to the smallest vessels of war, except
cutters. They are either rigged as ships or as snows. See <span class='sc'>Command</span>, <span class='sc'>Horse</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Rate</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> SLUE, is to turn any cylindrical or conical piece of timber about its
axis, without removing it. This term is generally expressed of the movement
by which a mast or boom is turned about, in its <i>cap</i> or <i>boom-iron</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SMACK, a small vessel commonly rigged as a <i>sloop</i> or <i>hoy</i>, used in the
coasting or fishing trade; or as a <i>tender</i> in the King’s service.</p>

<p class='c008'>SNATCH-BLOCK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galoche</span></i>, a block having an opening in one of its sides,
wherein to fix the <i>bight</i> of rope occasionally. See <span class='sc'>Block</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SNOTTER. See the article <span class='sc'>Sprit</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SNOW, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">senau</span></i>, is generally the largest of all two-masted vessels employed
by Europeans, and the most convenient for navigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sails and rigging on the main-mast and fore-mast of a snow, are exactly
similar to those on the same masts in a ship; only that there is a small mast
behind the main-mast of the former, which carries a sail nearly resembling
the <i>mizen</i> of a ship. The foot of this mast is fixed in a block of wood on the
quarter-deck abaft the main-mast; and the head of it is attached to the afterpart
of the main-<i>top</i>. The sail, which is called the try-sail, is extended from
its mast towards the stern of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the <i>sloops</i> of war are rigged as snows, they are furnished with a <i>horse</i>,
which answers the purpose of the trysail-mast, the fore part of the sail being
attached by rings to the said horse, in different parts of its height.</p>

<p class='c008'>SOLE, a name sometimes given to the lower side of a gun-port, which
however is more properly called the port-sell.</p>

<p class='c008'>SOUNDING, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sonder</span></i>, Fr.) the operation of trying the depth of the water,
and the quality of the ground, by means of a plummet, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plomb de sonde</span></i>,
sunk from a ship to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are two plummets used for this purpose in navigation; one of which
is called the hand-lead, weighing about 8 or 9 pound; and the other the
deep-sea-lead, which weighs from 25 to 30 pound, and both are shaped like
the frustrum of a cone or pyramid. The former is used in shallow waters, and
the latter at a great distance from the shore; particularly on approaching the
land, after a sea-voyage. Accordingly the lines employed for this purpose
are called the deep-sea lead-line, and the hand lead-line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hand lead-line, which is usually 20 fathoms in length, is marked at
every 2 or 3 fathoms; so that the depth of the water may be ascertained either
in the day or night. At the depth of 2 and 3 fathoms, there are marks of
black leather; at 5 fathom, there is a white rag; at 7, a red rag; at 10,
black leather; at 13, black leather; at 15, a white rag; and at 17, a red
ditto.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sounding with the hand-lead, which is called heaving the lead by seamen,
is generally performed by a man who stands in the main-<i>chains</i> to windward.
Having the line all ready to run out, without interrupton, he holds it nearly at
the distance of a fathom from the plummet, and having swung the latter backwards
and forwards three or four times, in order to acquire the greater velocity,
he swings it round his head, and thence, as far forward as is necessary; so
that, by the lead’s sinking whilst the ship advances, the line may be almost perpendicular
when it reaches the bottom. The person sounding then proclaims
the depth of the water in a kind of song resembling the cries of hawkers in
a city. Thus, if the mark of 5 fathoms is close to the surface of the water, he
calls ‘By the mark five!’ and as there is no mark at 4, 6, 8, &amp;c. he estimates
those numbers, and calls, ‘By the dip four,’ &amp;c. If he judges it to be a quarter, or
an half more than any particular number, he calls, ‘And a quarter five! and a
half four,’ &amp;c. If he conceives the depth to be 3 quarters more than a particular
number, he calls it a quarter less than the next: thus, at 4 fathom
and ¾, he calls ‘A quarter less five!’ and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>The deep-sea-lead is marked with two knots at 20 fathom, 3 at 30, 4 at
40, and so on to the end. It is also marked with a single knot in the middle
of each interval, as at 25, 35, 45 fathoms, &amp;c. To use this lead more effectually
at sea, or in deep water on the sea-coast, it is usual previously to
<i>bring-to</i> the ship, in order to retard her course: the lead is then thrown as far
as possible from the ship on the line of her drift, so that, as it sinks, the ship
drives more perpendicularly over it. The pilot feeling the lead strike the
bottom, readily discovers the depth of the water by the mark on the line
nearest its surface. The bottom of the lead being also well rubbed over with
tallow, retains the distinguishing marks of the bottom, as shells, ooze, gravel,
&amp;c. which naturally adheres to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The depth of the water, and the nature of the ground, which is called the
soundings, are carefully marked in the log-book, as well to determine the
distance of the place from the shore, as to correct the observations of former
pilots. See <span class='sc'>Coasting</span> and <span class='sc'>Navigation</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPAN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pendour</span></i> (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">spanna</span></i>, Ital.) a small line or cord, the middle of which is
usually attached to a stay, from whence the two ends branch outwards to the
right and left, and having either a <i>block</i> or <i>thimble</i> attached to their extremities.
The intention of the span is accordingly to confine some rope which
passes through the corresponding block or thimble, as well to increase the effort
of the said rope, as to prevent it from swinging at too great a distance
from the centre of its action in stormy weather. Such are the spans occasionally
used for the top-gallant <i>braces</i>, or the fore-top-gallant <i>bowlines</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPARE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rechange</span></i>, an epithet applied to any part of a ship’s equipage,
or furniture, that lies in reserve, to supply the place of such as may be lost, or
rendered incapable of service. Hence we say, spare top-masts, spare sails,
spare rigging, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>PUMP-SPEAR. See the article <span class='sc'>Pump</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPELL, the period wherein a sailor, or gang of sailors, is employed in
a particular exercise, from which they are relieved as soon as the limited time
expires. Such are the spells, to the hand-lead in sounding; to the pump; to
look out on the mast-head, &amp;c. and to steer the ship; which last, however,
is generally called the <i>trick</i>. See <span class='sc'>Steering</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spell also implies the relief, or the return of duty to those services: Thus
we say, spell the pump, spell the lead, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> SPILL, to discharge the wind out of the cavity or belly of a sail when
it is drawn up in the brails in order to <i>furl</i> or <i>reef</i> it. This is either performed
by collecting the sail together, or by bracing its edge to the wind, so
as to shiver or be laid aback.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPILLING-LINES, certain ropes fixed occasionally to the main-sail and
fore-sail of a ship, in tempestuous weather, for reefing or furling them more
conveniently. They are passed through blocks above the yard, and thence
leading down before the sail, come under its bottom, and return upwards behind
it to the yard, where they are fastened; so that the sail, by their effort, is
closely and immoveably confined to the yard.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPINDLE, a sort of iron-pin tapering at the upper end to a point. It is
used to stick into the upper end of the top-gallant-mast, so as to carry a vane,
which, turning thereon horizontally, will show the direction of the wind. It
is usually crowned with a globular or conical piece of wood called the acorn,
which prevents the vane from being blown off. See <span class='sc'>Acorn</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Spindle</span> is also the lower end or foot of the capstern, which is shod with
iron, and becomes the pivot or axis upon which it turns in the saucer. See
the article <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPIRKETTING, that range of planks which lies between the water-ways

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> SPLICE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">episser</span></i> (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">splitser</span></i> Dutch, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">plico</span></i> Lat.) to join the two ends of a
rope together, or to unite the end of a rope to any other part thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are several different methods of performing this operation, according
to the services on which it is to be employed. Thus, there is the short-splice,
the long-splice, the eye-splice, and the cunt-splice; all of which are calculated
for different purposes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The short-splice is made by untwisting the ends of two ropes, or the
two ends of one rope, and, having placed each of the <i>strands</i> of one opposite
to and in the interval between two <i>strands</i> of the other, to draw them close
together; and then interweave the strands of one into the alternate strands of
the other, by penetrating the latter with a <i>fid</i> or marline-spike, parallel to the axis
or length of the rope. This splice is used on the cables, slings, block-strops,
and in general all ropes which are not intended to run through blocks, or
where the splice is not in danger of being loosened or separated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The long-splice being fixed in three places, occupies a greater extent of the
rope; but by the division of the joinings, the bulk is also divided into different
parts of its length. Hence it is much neater and smoother than the short-splice,
and better adapted to run through the channel of a block, &amp;c. for
which use it is generally calculated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The eye-splice being intended to make a sort of eye or circle at the end of
a rope, the strands are untwisted, and their extremities thrust through the
three strands in that part of the said rope, whereon the splice is to be formed,
and thence passing over the surface of the second strand, they are again thrust
through the third, which compleats the operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cunt-splice is constructed in the same manner as the eye-splice, being
no other than the ends of two lines fastened together at a short distance from
each other, the extremities of either being interwoven into the <i>bight</i> of the
other, so that the line becomes double in the extent of the splice. This is
chiefly used in lead-lines, log-lines, and fishing-lines, where the short-splice
would be liable to separation, as being frequently loosened by the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPLIT, the state of a sail which is rent asunder by the violence of a tempest,
or by sustaining a greater effort on one part of its surface than the rest.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Split</span>, when applied to a ship, is also the state of being stranded and bilged
on a rock or shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPOON-DRIFT, a sort of showery sprinkling of the sea-water, swept from
the surface of the waves in a tempest, and flying according to the direction of
the wind like a vapour.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPOONING. By the explanation of this term in our dictionaries, it seems
formerly to have signified that movement, in navigation, which is now called
scudding. Be that as it may, there is at present no such phrase in our sea-language.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPRAY, the sprinkling of the sea, which is driven from the top of a wave in
stormy weather. It differs from spoon-drift, as being only blown occasionally
from the broken surface of a high wave, whereas the latter continues to fly
horizontally along the sea, without intermission, during the excess of a tempest
or hurricane.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPRING, a crack or breach running transversely or obliquely through
any part of a mast or yard, so as to render it unsafe to carry the usual
quantity of sail thereon.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Spring</span> is also a rope passed out of one extremity of a ship and attached to a
cable proceeding from the other, when she lies at anchor. It is usually performed
to bring the ship’s broad-side, or battery of cannon, to bear upon some distant
object; as another ship, or a fortress on the coast, &amp;c. When a ship rides by
anchors which are only carried out of one end, she will swing upon the surface
of the water like a weather-cock, according to the direction of the wind; unless
when the wind is opposed by a current. Now, if instead of being fastened
at one end, she is attached by ropes, which, proceeding from her head and
stern towards the same source, sustain an equal effort of the wind, it is evident
that her side will be presented to the wind; and that, by slackening one
of those ropes, and keeping fast the other, her side will lie more or less obliquely
to the wind, so as to be opposed to any distant object to the right
or left.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, if a ship rides with her head northerly, and it is required to cannonade
a fortress lying on the south or south-east: a hauser is run out of the stern,
and being carried forward, without her side, is attached to the cable, at a competent
distance ahead of the ship: the hauser is then tightened by the <i>capstern</i>
or tackles, and the cable being slackened, the ship immediately turns her side
towards the object intended to be battered.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Spring</span> is likewise a rope reaching diagonally from the stern of a ship to
the head of another which lies <i>along-side</i> or a-breast of her, at a short distance.
This is generally performed to make one of the ships <i>sheer</i> off, to a greater
distance from the other; or to make merchant-ships lie uniformly in the same
tier. Springs of this sort are therefore occasionally applied from a ship, to a
wharf or key, for the same purposes.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPRIT, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">spryttan</span></i>, Sax. to branch out) a small boom or pole which crosses
the sail of a boat diagonally, from the mast, to the upper hindmost corner of
the sail, which it is used to extend and elevate: the lower end of the sprit rests
in a sort of wreath or collar called the <i>snotter</i>, which encircles the mast in
that place. These sort of sails are accordingly called sprit-sails.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPRITSAIL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">civadiere</span></i>, a sail attached to a yard which hangs under the
bowsprit, as represented in fig. 2. <i>y</i>, plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. It is furnished with a large
hole in each of its lower corners, to evacuate the water with which the cavity,
or belly of it is frequently filled, by the surge of the sea when the ship
pitches.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Spritsail-topsail</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perroquet de beaupré</span></i>, a sail extended above the
former, by a yard which hangs across the <i>gib-boom</i>. The lower corners of
this sail are hauled <i>home</i> to the spritsail-yard-arms; after which the sail is
drawn out towards the extremity of the boom, in light winds, as any other
topsail-yard is hoisted upon its mast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Formerly the spritsail-topsails were set on a mast, which was erected perpendicularly
on the end of the bowsprit: but this method has of late been
justly rejected as inconvenient and dangerous to the bowsprit, although serviceable
in light breezes,</p>

<p class='c008'>SPUNGE. See the article <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SPUN-YARN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bittord</span></i>, a small line or cord formed of two or three rope-yarns
twisted together by a winch. The yarns of which it is usually made at
sea, are drawn out of the strands of old cables or other ropes, and are knotted
together and tarred. It is employed for several purposes; particularly
to fasten one rope to another, to seize block-strops to the shrouds, and to <i>serve</i>
ropes which are liable to be chafed by rubbing one against another, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SQUALL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raffale</span></i>, a sudden and violent blast of wind, usually occasioned
by the interruption and reverberation of the wind from high mountains.
These are very frequent in the Mediterranean; particularly that part
of it which is known by the name of the Levant, as produced by the repulsion,
and new direction which the wind meets with in its passage between the
various islands of the Archipelago.</p>

<p class='c008'>SQUARE, a term peculiarly appropriated to the yards and their sails, implying
that they hang at right angles with the mast or keel; or that they are
of greater extent than usual.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, when the yards are so balanced by their <i>lifts</i>, as to hang at right
angles with the mast, they are said to be square by the lifts: when they hang
perpendicular to the ship’s length, they are called square by the braces: but
when they lie in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the keel, they are
square by the lifts and braces; or, in other words, they hang directly across
the ship, and parallel to the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The yards are said to be very square, when they are of extraordinary length;
and the same epithet is then applied to their sails, which by consequence
acquire an additional breadth.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Square-rigged</span>, an epithet applied to a ship whose yards are very long.
It is also used in contradistinction to all vessels whose sails are extended by <i>stays</i>
or <i>lateen-yards</i>; or by booms and gaffs; the usual situation of which is nearly
in the plane of the keel; and hence</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Square-sail</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">treou</span></i>, is a sail extended to a yard, which hangs parallel to the
horizon, as distinguished from the other sails which are extended by <i>booms</i>
and stays, placed obliquely. This sail is only used in fair winds, or to scud
under in a tempest. In the former case, it is furnished with a large additional
part called the bonnet, which is then attached to its bottom, and removed
when it is necessary to <i>scud</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>STAFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baton</span></i>, a light pole erected in different parts of a ship, whereon to

<p class='c008'>The principal of these is reared immediately over the stern, to display the
<i>ensign</i>; another is fixed on the bowsprit, to extend the <i>jack</i>; three more are
erected at the three mast-heads, or formed by their upper ends, to show the
flag or pendant of the respective squadron or division to which the ship is appropriated.
See <span class='sc'>Ensign</span>, <span class='sc'>Mast</span>, <span class='sc'>Jack</span>, and <span class='sc'>Pendant</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STANCHION, a sort of small pillar of wood or iron used for various
purposes in a ship; as to support the decks, the quarter-rails, the <i>nettings</i>, the
<i>awnings</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of these are two ranges of small columns, fixed under the beams,
throughout the ship’s length <i>between-decks</i>; one range being on the starboard,
and the other on the larboard side of the hatchways. They are chiefly intended
to support the weight of the artillery.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Stanchions</span> <i>of the nettings</i>, are either slender bars of iron, whose lower
ends are fixed in iron sockets at proper distances; or square wooden pillars
let into the upper part of the ship’s side. See <span class='sc'>Quarter-netting</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STANDARD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courbe</span></i>, in ship-building, is no other than an inverted
knee, which is placed above the deck instead of beneath it, and having
its vertical branch pointed upwards from that which lies horizontally.
The figure and position of one of these standards is expressed by the curve line
<i>f</i>, which is dotted through the gun-carriage in the <span class='sc'>Midship-frame</span>, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>.
Such also are the standards of the bits and channels.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Royal</i> <span class='sc'>Standard</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etendard royale</span></i>, a flag in which the imperial ensigns of
Great Britain, and the arms of France and Ireland, together with the armorial
bearings of Hanover, are united and quartered. It is never hoisted unless
when the sovereign is personally aboard; at which time it is displayed at
the main-top-mast-head.</p>

<p class='c008'>STANDING, in navigation, the movement by which a ship advances
towards a certain object, or departs from it: as the enemy stands in-shore:
the English fleet are standing <i>off</i>: at day-break we discovered three sail
standing to the northward, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>STARBOARD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tribord</span></i>, the right side of the ship when the eye of the
spectator is directed forward. See <span class='sc'>Larboard</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STAY, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etai</span></i>, Fr.) a large strong rope employed to support the mast on the
fore part, by extending from its upper end towards the fore part of the ship,
as the shrouds are extended to the right and left, and behind it. See <span class='sc'>Mast</span>,
<span class='sc'>Rigging</span>, and <span class='sc'>Shroud</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stay of the fore-mast <i>a</i>, fig. 10. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. which is called the fore-stay,
reaches from the mast-head towards the bowsprit-end: the main-stay <i>b</i>, extends
over the fore-castle to the ship’s stem; and the mizen-stay <i>c</i>, is stretched down
to that part of the main-mast which lies immediately above the quarter-deck:
the fore-top-mast-stay <i>d</i>, comes also to the end of the bowsprit, a little beyond
the fore-stay: the main-top-mast-stay <i>e</i>, is attached to the head or <i>hounds</i>
of the fore-mast; and the mizen-top-mast-stay comes also to the hounds
of the main-mast: the fore-top-gallant-stay comes to the outer end of the
jib-boom; and the main-top-gallant-stay is extended to the head of the
fore-top-mast.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Stay-sail</span>, a sort of triangular sail extended upon a stay. See <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STEDDY, the command given by the pilot, &amp;c. to the helmsman, in a
<i>fair</i> wind, to steer the ship according to the line, on which she advances
at that instant, without deviating to the right or left. The helmsman
accordingly answers, steddy; to shew his attention and obedience to the
pilot’s order.</p>

<p class='c008'>STEERAGE, an apartment without the great <i>cabin</i> of a ship, from which
it is separated by a thin partition. In large ships of war it is used as a hall
through which it is necessary to pass to, arrive at, or depart from the great
cabin. In merchant-ships it is generally the habitation of the inferior officers
and ship’s crew. See also <span class='sc'>Birth</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Steerage</span> is also used to express the effort of the helm; and hence</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Steerage-way</span>, is that degree of progressive motion communicated to a
ship, by which she becomes susceptible of the effects of the helm to govern
her course. See <span class='sc'>Helm</span> and <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STEERING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouverner</span></i> (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">steoran</span></i>, Sax.) may be defined the art of directing
the ship’s way by the movements of the helm; or of applying its efforts to
regulate her course when she advances.</p>

<p class='c008'>The perfection of steering consists in a vigilant attention to the motion of
the ship’s <i>head</i>, so as to check every deviation from the line of her course in
the first instant of its motion; and in applying as little of the power of the
helm as possible. By this she will run more uniformly in a streight path, as
declining less to the right and left: whereas, if a greater effort of the helm is
employed, it will produce a greater declination from the course, and not only
increase the difficulty of steering, but also make a crooked and irregular tract
through the water. See <span class='sc'>Helm</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The helmsman should diligently watch the movements of the head by the
land, clouds, moon, or stars; because although the course is in general regulated
by the compass, yet the vibrations of the needle are not so quickly perceived,
as the sallies of the ship’s head to the right or left, which, if not immediately
restrained, will acquire additional velocity in every instant of their motion,
and demand a more powerful impulse of the helm to reduce them; the application
of which, will operate to turn her head as far on the contrary side of
her course.</p>

<p class='c008'>The phrases used in steering a ship vary according to the relation of the
wind to her course. Thus, if the wind is <i>fair</i>, or <i>large</i>, the phrases used by
the pilot, or officer, who superintends the steerage, are <i>port</i>, <i>starboard</i>, and
<i>steddy</i>. The first is intended to direct the ship’s course farther to the right;
the second is to guide her farther to the left; and the last, as explained under that
word, is designed to keep her exactly in the line, whereon she advances, according
to the course prescribed. The excess of the first and second movement
is called hard-a-port, and hard-a-starboard; the former of which gives
her the greatest possible inclination to the right, and the latter an equal tendency
to the left.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, on the contrary, the wind is <i>foul</i> or <i>scant</i>, the phrases are <i>luff</i>, <i>thus</i>,
and <i>no nearer</i>; the first of which is the order to keep her close to the wind;
the second, to retain her in her present situation; and the third, to keep her
sails full. The effects of these movements are farther explained under the several
terms; but more particularly under the article <span class='sc'>Full and By</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a ship of war, the exercise of steering the ship is usually divided amongst
a number of the most expert sailors, who attend the helm in their turns; and
are accordingly called <i>timoneers</i>, from the French term <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">timonier</span></i>, which signifies
helmsman. The steerage is constantly supervised by the quarter-masters,
who also attend the helm by rotation. In merchant-ships every seaman takes
his turn in this service, being directed therein by the mate of the watch, or
some other officer.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the safety of a ship, and all contained therein, depend, in a great measure,
on the steerage or effects of the helm, the apparatus by which it is managed
should often be diligently examined by the proper officers. Indeed, a negligence
in this important duty appears almost unpardonable, when the fatal
effects which may result from it are duly considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>STEEVING, the elevation of a ship’s bowsprit above the stem, or the
angle which it makes with the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>STEM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etrave</span></i>, (<i><span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">stammen</span></i>, Swed.) a circular piece of timber, into which
the two sides of a ship are united at the fore end: the lower end of it is scarfed
to the <i>keel</i>, and the <i>bowsprit</i> rests upon its upper end.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stem is formed of one or two pieces, according to the size of the vessel;
and as it terminates the ship forward, the ends of the <i>wales</i> and planks of
the sides and bottom are let into a groove or channel, in the middle of its surface,
from the top to the bottom: which operation is called <i>rabetting</i>. See
that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>The out side of the stem is usually marked with a scale, or division of feet,
according to its perpendicular height from the keel. The intention of this, is
to ascertain the draught of water at the fore part, when the ship is in preparation
for a sea-voyage, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stem at its lower end is of equal breadth and thickness with the keel,
but it grows proportionally broader and thicker towards its upper extremity.
See <i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span> and <i>Ship</i>-<span class='sc'>Building</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STEMSON, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marsouin</span></i>, an arching piece of timber fixed within the apron
to reinforce the scarf thereof, in the same manner as the apron supports the
scarf of the stem. In large ships it is usually formed of two pieces, as represented
by I. in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces of the Hull</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STEP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carlingue</span></i>, a block of wood fixed on the decks or bottom of a ship,
and having a hole in its upper side fitted to receive the heel of a mast or
<i>capstern</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The steps of the main and fore-masts of every ship rest upon the kelson, as
appears in fig. 2. and 3. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. to which they are firmly secured by <i>knees</i>,
bolts, or spike-nails. The step of the mizen-mast usually rests upon the
lower deck. See also the article <span class='sc'>Capstern</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STERN, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arcasse</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">steor</span></i>, Sax.) the posterior face of a ship; or that part
which is presented to the view of a spectator, placed on the continuation of
the keel behind, as exhibited in plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. fig. 1, 2, and 3; and in plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>.
fig. 1.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stern, as represented in plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. is terminated above by the <i>taffarel</i>, and
below by the <i>counters</i>: It is limited on the sides by the quarter-pieces; and
the intermediate space comprehends the galleries and windows of the different
cabins.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 2. exhibits a stern view of a 60 gun-ship, with the curve of the <i>frame-timbers</i>
on one side, and the disposition of all the planks of the bottom on
the other side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 3. represents a stern view of a French man of war of 70 guns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. fig. 1. is a stern for a first or second rate: accordingly it is furnished
with a middle apartment between the ward-room and the captain’s cabin.
This apartment is also furnished with galleries on the stern and quarter.
The other parts of it are described in the explanation of fig. 1. in
plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. See also the article <span class='sc'>Quarter</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Stern-fast</span>, a rope used to confine the stern of a ship or boat to any wharf
or jetty-head, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sternmost</span>, usually implies that part of a fleet of ships which is in the
rear, or farthest astern, as opposed to <i>head-most</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Stern-post</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etambot</span></i>, a long straight piece of timber erected on the extremity
of the <i>keel</i>, to sustain the rudder, and terminate the ship behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>This piece, which is expressed by B in the <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Hull</span>, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>.
ought to be well secured and supported; because the ends of all the lower
planks of the ship’s bottom are fixed in a channel, cut on its surface; and the
whole weight of the rudder is sustained by it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dimensions of the stern-post, or the proportional breadth and thickness,
in the different parts of its height, are geometrically delineated in the
<i>quarter</i> and stern of a 74 gun-ship, plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. and X. being expressed in both
by A B. It is usually marked like the <i>stem</i>, with a scale of feet from the keel
upwards, in order to ascertain the draught of water, at that part of the
vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The difficulty of procuring a stern-post of sufficient breadth in one piece,
has introduced the practice of fixing an additional piece behind it, which is
strongly bolted to the former. The hinges, which support the rudder, are
accordingly fixed to this latter, which is also tenanted into the keel, and denominated
the back of the <i>post</i>, being expressed by E in the <i>pieces</i> of the <i>hull</i>,
referred to above. It is half the breadth of the stern-post, at the heel, but
diminishes gradually towards the upper end, where it is one third narrower.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stern-post is strongly attached to the keel by a knee, G, <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> of the
<span class='sc'>Hull</span>, of which one branch extends along the keel, being <i>scarfed</i> and bolted
to the <i>dead-wood</i>, and fore-locked under the keel; whilst the other branch inclines
upwards, and corresponds with the inside, or fore part of the stern-post;
to which it is also bolted in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Stern-sheets</span>, that part of a boat which is contained between the stern and
the aftmost, or hindmost, seat of the <i>rowers</i>. It is generally furnished with
benches, to accommodate the passengers. See the article <span class='sc'>Boat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Stern-way</span>, the movement by which a ship retreats, or falls backward,
with her stern foremost.</p>

<p class='c008'>STEWARD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maitre-valet</span></i>, an officer in a ship of war, appointed by the
purser, to distribute the different species of provisions to the officers and crew;
for which purpose he is furnished with a mate, and proper assistants.</p>

<p class='c008'>STIFF, the quality by which a ship is enabled to carry a sufficient quantity
of sail, without hazard of oversetting. See the articles <span class='sc'>Ballast</span> and
<span class='sc'>Trim</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STINK-POT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot à feu</span></i>, an earthen jar, or shell, charged with powder,
grenadoes, and other materials of an offensive and suffocating smell. It is
frequently used by privateers, in the western ocean, in the attack of an enemy,
whom he designs to board; for which purpose it is furnished with a
lighted fuse, at the opening or touch-hole. See <span class='sc'>Boarding</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STIRRUPS. See the article <span class='sc'>Horse</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STOCKS, a frame erected on the shore of a river, or harbour, whereon to
build shipping. It generally consists of a number of wooden blocks, ranged
parallel to each other, at convenient distances, and with a gradual declivity towards
the water. See <span class='sc'>Lanching</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STOPPERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bosses</span></i>, certain short pieces of rope, which are usually <i>knotted</i>
at one, or both ends, according to the purpose for which they are calculated.
They are either used to suspend any weighty body, or to retain a cable, <i>shroud</i>,
&amp;c. in a fixed position.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, the anchors, when first hoisted up from the ground, are hung to
the cat-head, by a stopper attached to the latter, which passing through the
anchor-ring, is afterwards fastened to the timber-head, <i>n</i>, fig. 10. plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>.
and the same rope serves to fasten it on the <i>bow</i> at sea; or to suspend it by
the ring when it is to be sunk from the ship to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stoppers of the cables have a large knot, and a <i>laniard</i>, at one end, and
are fastened to a ring-bolt in the deck, by the other. They are attached to
the cable, by the laniard, which is fastened securely round both by several
turns passed behind the knot, or about the neck of the stopper; by which
means the cable is restrained from running out of the ship, when she
rides at anchor. See also <span class='sc'>Bits</span> and <span class='sc'>Ring-rope</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stoppers of the shrouds have a knot and a laniard at each end. They
are only used when the shrouds are cut asunder in battle, or disabled by tempestuous
weather; at which time they are <i>lashed</i>, in the same manner as those
of the cables, to the separated parts of the shroud, which are thereby reunited,
so as to be fit for immediate service. This, however, is only a temporary
expedient, applied when there is not time or opportunity to refit them,
by a more complete operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>STORE-KEEPER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garde-magasin</span></i>, an officer in the royal dock-yards, invested
with the charge of the principal naval stores; as the sails, anchors,
cordage, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Store-room</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soute</span></i>, an apartment, or place of reserve, of which there are
several in a ship, to contain the provisions, or stores of a ship, together with
those of her officers, during a sea-voyage.</p>

<p class='c008'>STOWAGE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrimage</span></i>, the general disposition of the several materials
contained in a ship’s hold, with regard to their figure, magnitude, or solidity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the stowage of different articles, as ballast, casks, cases, bales, and boxes,
there are several general rules to be observed, according to the circumstances
or qualities of those materials. The casks, which contain any liquid, are, according
to the sea phrase, to be <i>bung-up</i> and <i>bilge-free</i>, i. e. closely wedged up,
in an horizontal position, and resting on their quarters: so that the bilges, where
they are thickest, being entirely free all round, cannot rub against each
other, by the motion of the vessel. Dry goods, or such as may be damaged
by the water, are to be carefully inclosed in casks, bales, cases, or wrappers;
and wedged off from the bottom and sides of the ship, as well as from
the bows, masts, and pump-well. Due attention must likewise be had to
their disposition, with regard to each other, and to the trim and centre of
gravity of the ship; so that the heaviest may always be nearest the keel, and
the lightest gradually above them. See <span class='sc'>Ballast</span>, <span class='sc'>Trim</span>, and <span class='sc'>Rolling</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STRAIT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etroite</span></i>, a narrow channel, or arm of the sea, contained between
two opposite shores; as the straits of Gibraltar; the straits of Sunda; the
straits of Dover, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>STRAKES, or STREAKS, the uniform ranges of planks on the bottom
and sides of a ship; or the continuation of planks joined to the end of each
other, and reaching from the <i>stem</i>, which limits the vessel forward, to the
<i>stern-post</i>, and fashion-<i>pieces</i>, which terminate her length abaft. The lowest
of these, which is called the <i>garboard-streak</i>, is let into the keel below, and
into the stem and stern-post. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>STRAND, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">touron</span></i>, one of the twists, or divisions, of which a rope is composed.
See the articles <span class='sc'>Rope</span> and <span class='sc'>Cable</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Strand</span> also implies the sea-beach: hence a ship is said to be stranded when
she has run a-ground on the sea-shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>STRETCHER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">banquet</span></i>, a sort of staff fixed athwart the bottom of a boat,
for the rower to place his feet against, in order to communicate a greater
effort to his oar.</p>

<p class='c008'>STRETCHING, <i>in navigation</i>, is generally understood to imply the
progression of a ship under a great surface of sail, when <i>close-hauled</i>. The
difference between this phrase and <i>standing</i>, is apparently in the quantity of
sail, which, in the latter, may be very moderate; but in stretching, generally
signifies excess: as, we saw the enemy at day-break stretching to the southward,
under a crowd of sail, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> STRIKE, <i>in navigation</i>, to run ashore, or to beat upon the ground
in passing over a bank or shallow.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Strike</span> also implies to lower or let down any thing; as an ensign, or
topsail, in saluting; or, as the yards and topmasts in tempestuous weather.
It is, however, more particularly used to express the lowering of the colours,
in token of surrender, to a victorious enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>STRING <i>in ship-building</i>, the highest range of planks in a ship’s
ceiling; or that which lies between the <i>gunnel</i>, and the upper edge of the
upper deck-ports, as expressed by T in the <span class='sc'>Midship-Frame</span>, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> STRIP <i>the masts</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">defuner</span></i>, is to unrig a ship, or deprive the masts
of their machinery and furniture; an exercise which is otherwise called dismantling.</p>

<p class='c008'>STROKE, a single sweep of the oars in rowing. Hence they say, Row a
long stroke! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">longue rime!</span></i> which is intended to push the vessel forward more
steddily. See the article <span class='sc'>Oar</span>; as also the French term <span class='sc'>Nager</span>, and the
phrases following it.</p>

<p class='c008'>STROP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etrope</span></i>, a piece of rope <i>spliced</i> into a circular wreath, and used to

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Strops</span> are also used occasionally to fasten upon any large rope, for the
purpose of hooking a <i>tackle</i> to the eye, or double part of the strop; in order to
extend, or pull with redoubled effort, upon the said rope; as in <i>setting-up</i> the
rigging, where one hook of the tackle is fixed in a strop applied to the particular

<p class='c008'>STUDDING-SAILS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonettes en etui</span></i>, certain light sails extended, in moderate
and steddy breezes, beyond the skirts of the principal sails, where they
appear as wings upon the yard-arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The word may be traced from several derivations; as from <i>scud</i>, <i>stead</i>, or
<i>steddy</i>. The small sails used by <i>sloops</i>, schooners, and tartanes, when scudding,
are nearly of the same size and figure with the lower studding-sails; and the
accidental application of the former, to the usual design of the latter, throws
a probability on the derivation from <i>scud</i>; especially as being used in the small
vessels of our ancestors, who were unacquainted with topmasts; and, of
course, had no conception of topmast-studding-sails. An ingenious friend of
the author, seems, with greater propriety, to derive it from steddy; because,
when the wind is extremely feeble, the fluctuation of the sea, although almost
imperceptible, is communicated to the ship, and thence to the principal
sails; which, being shaken and slapped against the masts, will, by their
weight, prevent, or at least considerably diminish, the operation of the wind.
The studding-sails, on the contrary, being of a much lighter and thinner
texture, more readily feel the effort of the breeze, and continue inflated, so
as to push the ship forward, and give her head-way. By this circumstance,
she becomes susceptible of the power of the helm, and is accordingly retained
in a steddy course; and hence those sails may originally have been called <i>steddying</i>-sails,
afterwards corrupted into studding-sails. The last conjecture,
which seems equally favourable, is drawn from the Saxon word <i>sted</i>, to help or
assist; in which sense, those sails may be considered as auxiliar, being set occasionally
to help the others, or assist the ship’s course; and thence called steading,
or stedding-sails. But the expression of <i>steering sails</i>, however adopted
by many officers, is a most contemptible conceit, without either authority or
reason to support it. The others are implicitly submitted to the reader’s decision.</p>

<p class='c008'>The topmast studding-sails, or those which are set on the out side of the topsails,
are spread below by a boom, which, sliding out from the extremities of
the main and fore-yards, as explained in the article <span class='sc'>Saddle</span>, pushes out their
lower corners: and their upper edges, which are attached to a light pole, are
hoisted up to the topsail-yard-arms. See also <span class='sc'>Boom-iron</span>, in the article <span class='sc'>Iron-work</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lower studding-sails, which are spread beyond the skirts or <i>leech</i> of
the main-sail and fore-sail, are fixed nearly in the same manner; only that the
boom, which extends their bottoms, is generally hooked to the <i>chains</i> by
means of a <i>goose-neck</i>; or else swings off along with the sail, to which it is
suspended; being kept steddy behind by a rope called the <i>guy</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>STUFF, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courrée</span></i>, any composition, or melted mass, used to smear or daub the
masts, sides, or bottom of a ship. That which is chiefly used for the lower masts
is simply turpentine, rosin, or varnish of pine: for the topmasts, tallow or
butter: for the sides, turpentine, varnish of pine, tar and oil, or tar mixed
with oil and red oker: and for the bottom, a mixture of tallow, sulphur, and
rosin, or tar: whale-oil and broken glass; or any part of these ingredients: and
this application is called giving a new coat of stuff to the masts, sides, &amp;c.</p>

person, who uses it, is called the swabber.</p>

<p class='c008'>SWEEPING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">draguer</span></i>, the act of dragging the bight, or loose part of a small
rope, along the surface of the ground, in a harbour, or road, in order to hook
and recover some anchor, wreck, or other material, sunk at the bottom. It is
performed by fastening the two ends of this rope to the sides of two boats which
are abreast of each other, at some distance. To the middle of the rope are suspended
two cannon-shot, or something which weighs heavy, in order to sink it
to the ground; so that, as the boats advance, by rowing ahead, the rope drags

motion of the sea, which remains after the expiration of a storm: as also, to
that which breaks on the sea-shore; or upon rocks, or shallows.</p>

<p class='c008'>SWIFTER, a rope used to confine the bars of the capstern in their sockets,
whilst the men are heaving it about; for which purpose it is passed through
holes in the extremities of the bars, so as to strain them firmly together like

<span class='sc'>Capstern</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Swifter</span> is also a strong rope, sometimes used to encircle a boat longitudinally,
as well as to strengthen and defend her sides, as to enable her the better

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>TABLING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bander</span></i>, a sort of broad hem formed on the skirts and bottoms

<p class='c008'>TACK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couet</span></i>, a rope used to confine the foremost lower-corners of the
<i>courses</i> and <i>stay-sails</i> in a fixed position, when the wind crosses the ship’s course
obliquely. The same name is also given to the rope employed to pull out the
lower corner of a <i>studding-sail</i> or <i>driver</i> to the extremity of its boom.</p>

<p class='c008'>The main-sail and fore-sail of a ship are furnished with a tack on each side,
which is formed of a thick rope tapering to the end, and having a knot
wrought upon the largest end, by which it is firmly retained in the clue of
the sail. By this means one tack is always fastened to windward, at the same
time that the <i>sheet</i> extends the sail to leeward. See <span class='sc'>Chestree</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tack</span> is also applied, by analogy, to that part of any sail to which the
tack is usually fastened.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship is said to be on the starboard or larboard tack, when she is <i>close-hauled</i>,
with the wind upon the starboard or larboard side; and in this sense the
distance which she sails in that position is considered as the length of the tack;
although this is more frequently called a <span class='sc'>Board</span>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Tack</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">virer vent devant</span></i>, to change the course from one board to another,
or turn the ship about from the starboard to the larboard tack, in a contrary
wind. Thus the ship A, fig. 2. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. being close-hauled on the
larboard tack, and turning her prow suddenly to windward, receives the impression
of the wind on her head-sails <i>a</i>, by which she falls off upon the line
of the starboard tack <i>a</i>. Tacking is also used, in a more enlarged sense, to
imply that manœuvre, in navigation, by which a ship makes an oblique progression
to the windward, in a zigzag direction. This, however, is more
usually called beating or turning to windward. See <span class='sc'>Beating</span> and <span class='sc'>Turning</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, suppose a ship A, fig. 2. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. bound to a port B lying to
windward, with the wind northerly, as expressed by the arrow. The sails <i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, being braced obliquely with the keel, the wind also falls upon their surfaces
in an oblique direction, by which the ship is pushed to leeward, as explained
in the article <span class='sc'>Lee-way</span>. Hence, although she apparently sails W. N.
W. upon the larboard tack, as expressed in the dotted line A <i>d</i>, and E. N. E.
upon the other <i>d f</i>, yet if the lee-way is only one point, (and indeed it is seldom
less in the smoothest water), the course will accordingly be W. <i>by</i> N.
upon one tack, and E. <i>by</i> N. upon the other, as represented by the lines
A <i>e</i>, and <i>e g</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the port A were directly to windward of the ship, it is evident that both
tacks ought to be of equal length; or, in other words, that she ought to run the
same distance upon each tack: but as the place of her destination lies obliquely
to windward, she must run a greater distance upon one tack than the other;
because the extremities of both <i>boards</i> should be equally distant from the line
of her true course B A; so the larboard tack A <i>e</i>, crossing the course more
obliquely than the other <i>e g</i>, will necessarily be much longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the true course, or the direct distance from B to A, is only 12 leagues,
it is evident, that with a favourable wind she could reach it in a few hours.
On the contrary, her distance is considerably increased by the length of her
boards, in a contrary wind; which, by its obliquity with her sails, operates also
to retard her velocity. Thus her first board A <i>e</i>, on a W. <i>by</i> N. course, is
equal to 5.7 leagues. The second tack <i>e g</i> is 9.2 leagues E. <i>by</i> N.: the
third tack, parallel to A <i>e</i>, is 11.5: the fourth, parallel to <i>e g</i>, is 9.2: and
the fifth, parallel to the first, 11.7 leagues. Finally, the sixth board is
4.8 leagues, parallel to the second, which brings her to the port B. By
this scheme it appears that she has run more than four times the extent
of the line A B, her primitive distance; and this in the most favourable
circumstances of a contrary wind, viz. when the sea is smooth, and
when she may carry her full topsails. For if the wind blows stronger, to
render it necessary to <i>reef</i> the topsails, she will soon make two points of <i>lee-way</i>,
and accordingly run east on one board, and west on the other. In this
situation she will neither approach, nor recede from the place of her destination:
but if the wind increases, the sea will also be enlarged; a circumstance
that still farther augments the lee-way. Hence the vessel will gradually fall
off from the port, in proportion to the augmentation of the wind and sea,
which occasions a proportional increase of lee-way.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to explain the theory of tacking a ship, it may be necessary to premise
a known axiom in natural philosophy, That every body will persevere
in a state of rest, or of moving uniformly in a right line, unless it be compelled
to change its state by forces impressed; and that the change of motion
is proportional to the moving force impressed, and is made according to the
right line in which that force is exerted.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this principle it is easy to conceive how a ship is compelled to turn into
any direction, by the force of the wind acting upon her sails, in horizontal
lines. For the sails may be so arranged as to receive the current of air, either
directly, or more or less obliquely: hence the motion communicated to the
sails must of necessity conspire with that of the wind upon their surfaces. To
make the ship tack, or turn round with her head to the windward, it is therefore
necessary, after she has received the first impression from the <i>helm</i>, that the
head-sails should be so disposed as to diminish the effort of the wind, in the first
instant of her motion, and that the whole force of the wind should be exerted
on the <i>after</i>-sails, which operating on the ship’s stern, carries it round like a
weather-cock. But since the action of the after-sails, to turn the ship, will unavoidably
cease when her head points to the windward, it then becomes necessary
to use the head-sails, to prevent her from <i>falling-off</i>, and returning to
her former situation. These are accordingly laid <i>aback</i> on the lee-side, to push
the vessel’s fore-part towards the opposite side, till she has fallen into the line
of her course thereon, and fixed her sails to conform with that situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been observed above, that the first effort to turn the ship in tacking
is communicated by the helm, which is then put to the lee-side. This circumstance
being announced by the pilot, or commanding-officer, who then
calls out, <i>Helm’s a-lee!</i> the head-sails are immediately made to shiver in the
wind, by casting loose their <i>sheets</i>, or <i>bowlines</i>. The pilot then calls, <i>Up tacks
and sheets!</i> which is executed by loosening all the ropes which confine the corners
of the lower sails, in order that they may be more readily shifted to the
other side. When the ship has turned her head directly to windward, as in <i>d</i>,
fig. 2. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. the pilot gives the order to turn about the sails on the main
and mizen masts, by the exclamation, <i>Haul main-sail, haul!</i> the bowlines
and braces are then instantly cast off on one side, and as expeditiously drawn
in on the other side, so as to wheel the yards about their masts: the lower corner
of the main-sail is, by means of its tack, pulled down to its station at the
chestree; and all the after-sails are, at the same time, adjusted to stand upon
the other board. Finally, when the ship has fallen off five or six points, as <i>h</i>,
fig. 2. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. the pilot cries, <i>Haul of all!</i> or, <i>Let go, and haul!</i> the
sails on the fore-mast are wheeled about by their braces: and as the ship
has then a tendency to fall off, she is checked by the effort of the helm, which
for that purpose is put <i>hard a-lee</i>. The fore-tack, or the lower corner of the
fore-sail, being fixed in its place, the bowlines are hauled; and the other sails,
which have been neglected in the hurry of tacking, are properly arranged to
the wind, which exercise is called trimming the sails. See <span class='sc'>Lee-way</span> and
<span class='sc'>Sailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TACKLE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">palan</span></i>, pronounced <i>taicle</i>, a machine formed by the communication
of a rope with an assemblage of blocks, and known in mechanics
by the name of pulley.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tackles are used in a ship to raise, remove, or secure weighty bodies; to
support the masts; or to extend the sails and rigging. They are either moveable,
as communicating with a <i>runner</i>; or fixed, as being hooked in an immoveable
station; and they are more or less complicated, in proportion to the
effects which they are intended to produce.</p>

<p class='c008'>If <i>a b d e</i>, fig. 3. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a> be a single block, upon which are suspended
the weights <i>f g</i>, then since the nearest distance of the ropes <i>f g</i>, from the center
of motion <i>c</i>, are <i>a c</i> equal to <i>d c</i>, the block will be reduced to the lever
or balance <i>a d</i> with respect to its power: Since <i>a c</i> is then equal to <i>d c</i>, it is
apparent that <i>f g</i> will always be in equilibrium. As no advantage therefore
can be acquired, in raising a weight by an immoveable single block, it is only
rendered useful by changing the direction of the moving power. This circumstance
is extremely convenient to the labourers, and often absolutely necessary;
particularly in raising bodies to a higher station; as from the hold to
the upper decks, or from the deck to the masts or yards, &amp;c. which would
otherwise be difficult or impracticable to perform. See also the articles <span class='sc'>Block</span>
and <span class='sc'>Whip</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a single block is moveable along with the body to which it is attached,
fig. 4. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. as the blocks of the <i>brace-pendants</i>, <i>reef-tackle pendants</i>,
<i>jiggers</i>, &amp;c. the momentum of the power is doubled; because it moves twice
as fast as the weight, or body to which it is attached. For in the same time
that any part of the rope <i>f</i>, moves upward from <i>f</i> to <i>g</i>, equal in length to the
two equal ropes <i>d</i> and <i>c</i>, the block, and consequently the weight annexed,
will be drawn through the space <i>e h</i>, whose length is equal to one of the ropes
only.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a tackle consists of two or more fixed and moveable blocks, wherein
one rope communicates with the whole; if one end of the rope be fixed,
as in fig. 5. 6. and 7. in order to proportion the weight to the resistance, the
power applied must be to the weight, as one, to twice the number of <i>sheaves</i> in
the moveable blocks: because, in the efforts of a tackle, the velocity of the
moving power is, to the velocity of the rising or moving body, as twice the
number of moveable sheaves to unity, as appears in fig. 5. which consists of
one fixed block <i>a</i>, and another moveable as <i>e</i>. For since one rope operates
on all the sheaves from <i>g</i> to <i>f</i>, the part at <i>f</i>, lying beyond the fixed block,
and called the <i>fall</i>, cannot be drawn down and lengthened, unless the two parts
<i>d</i> and <i>c</i>, on each side of the moveable block, be at the same time equally drawn
up and shortened. Hence it is evident, that the part <i>a f</i> will be lengthened
twice as much as either <i>d</i> or <i>c</i> is shortened, because whatever is taken from
each of those parts is added to the length of <i>a f</i>; but the point <i>f</i>, to which
the power is applied, descends as fast as <i>a f</i> is lengthened and the point <i>e</i>,
to which the weight is fastened, ascends as fast as <i>d</i> or <i>c</i> is shortened. If
therefore, a weight suspended at <i>f</i>, be to a weight suspended at <i>e</i>, as one to
two, they will balance each other, as being in the reciprocal ratio of their
velocities.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever has been observed with regard to the tackles above mentioned,
is equally applicable to all others, and is in the same manner demonstrable,
viz. that the velocity with which the mechanical force moves, in raising
a weight, is to the velocity wherewith the weight rises, as twice the number
of moveable sheaves to unity.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tackle wherein both the blocks are moveable, and communicate with a
runner, is represented by fig. 10. plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. That part of the tackle which
is fixed to one of the blocks, &amp;c. is called the standing part; all the rest are
called running parts; and that whereon the men pull when employing the
tackle, is called the <i>fall</i>. The application of the tackle to mechanical purposes

of rowing, the oar is contained between the two tholes, in the space
which is called the <i>row-lock</i>. Sometimes there is only one pin to each oar, as
in the boats navigated on the Mediterranean sea. In that case the oar is hung
upon the pin by means of a strop; and indeed this method is much more ancient
than the former. See the article <span class='sc'>Rowing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>THROAT, a name given to the inner end of a <i>gaff</i>, or to that part which
is next to the mast. It is opposed to <i>peek</i>, which implies the outer extremity of
the said gaff, or that part of it which extends the sail behind. Hence the
ropes employed to hoist up, and lower a gaff, being applied to those parts of
it, are called the throat and peek haliards. See <i>Haliards</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>THUS! the order by which the pilot directs the helmsman to keep the
ship in her present situation when sailing with a <i>scant</i> wind; so that she may
not approach too near the direction of the wind, and thereby shiver her sails,
nor fall to leeward, and run farther out of her course. See <span class='sc'>Steering</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>THWART, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">banc</span></i>, the seat or bench of a boat whereon the rowers sit to

<p class='c008'>TIDE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marée</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">tyd</span></i>, Sax.) a regular periodical current of the water, setting
alternately in a flux and reflux, produced by the influence of the moon.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the ocean were equally deep in every place, the ebbing and flowing of
the tide would be universally regular and equal; but the shallowness of the
water in many places, and the streightness of the channels, by which the
tides may be considerably interrupted in some parts, and propagated in others,
occasion a great diversity in their force and quantity. Hence, without an
exact knowledge of all the circumstances of the several places where they
happen to run, as of the position of the land, the breadth and depth of channels;
it is impossible to account for this diversity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The theory of the tides is concisely described by a great author, in these
words: “That motion of the water called tides is a rising and falling of
the sea: the cause of this is the attraction of the moon, whereby the part
of water in the great ocean which is nearest the moon, being most strongly attracted,
is raised higher than the rest; and the part opposite to it being least
attracted, is also higher than the rest; and these two opposite elevations of
the surface of the water in the great ocean, following the motion of the moon
from est to west, and striking against the large coasts of the continents, from
thence rebounds back again, and so makes floods and ebbs in narrows, seas,
and rivers.” <cite>Locke.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the relative force of the tide on a ship floating therein, it is
already explained in the article <span class='sc'>Current</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TIER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">batterie</span></i>, a name given to the range of cannon mounted on one side
of a ship’s deck. See the articles <span class='sc'>Deck</span> and <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tier</span> <i>of the cable</i>, is a range of the <i>fakes</i> or windings of the cable, which
are laid within one another in an horizontal position, so as that the last becomes
the innermost. See <span class='sc'>Coiling</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cable</i>-<span class='sc'>Tier</span> is the hollow space in the middle of a cable, when it is <i>coiled</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TIGHT, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">dicht</span></i>, Dutch) the quality whereby a vessel resists the penetration
of any fluid, whether compressing its surface, or contained within it.
Hence a ship is said to be tight, when her planks are so compact and solid as
to prevent the entrance of the water in which she is immersed: and a cask is
called tight, when the staves are so close that none of the liquid contained
therein can issue through or between them. In both senses it is opposed to
<i>leaky</i>, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>TILLER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">timon</span></i>, or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barre de gouvernail</span></i>, the bar or lever employed to turn
the rudder in steering. See the article <span class='sc'>Helm</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TILT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tendelet</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">tyld</span></i>, Sax.) a small canopy or awning of canvas, or other
cloth, extended over the stern-sheets of a boat, and supported by small pillars,
or broad laths of flexible wood incurvated into arches. It is used to
cover the passengers from the rain or sunshine. See <span class='sc'>Boat</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TIMBERS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couples</span></i>, the ribs of a ship, or the incurvated pieces of wood,
branching outward from the keel in a vertical direction, so as to give strength,
figure, and solidity to the whole fabric.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been observed in the article <i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>, that one timber
is composed of several pieces united into one frame, which is accordingly
called a frame of timbers by the artificers. These different pieces are exhibited
in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. <span class='sc'>Pieces</span> of the <span class='sc'>Hull</span>, by U, V, and W. The head of the lower piece,
called the <i>floor</i>-timber, being cut square, to join the heel of the next above
it. To support the connection of the timber in that place, another assemblage
of pieces are formed, and joined in the same manner; so that when
both the sets are fastened together, the joinings in one set will be nearly opposite
to the middle of the pieces in the other. Hence it is evident, that the
mould which serves for the lowest piece will conform to the under part of the
corresponding piece above it: and thus the mould, appropriated to every division
of a timber, will determine, or answer to the figure of the next adjoining
thereto.</p>

<p class='c008'>The timbers whose areas or <i>planes</i> are perpendicular to the <i>keel</i>, are called
square timbers; and those which are placed obliquely on the keel, as at the
extremities of a ship, are called cant-timbers. The foremost of those pieces
on the ship’s <i>bow</i>, are called the knuckle-timbers; and the hindmost on the
quarter are called the fashion-pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>The outlines, or <i>bends</i> of the principal timbers of the ship are geometrically
delineated in the plane of projection, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. as also in plate <a href='#IV'>IV</a>. fig. 11.
and plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. fig. 2.: and their particular stations in the ship’s length are represented
in the horizontal plane, and that of the elevation, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. In order
to give a more comprehensive idea of their figures and dimensions, we have
exhibited a perspective view of the carcase of a small vessel, in plate <a href='#XII'>XII</a>.

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Timber and room</span>, or <i>room and space</i>, is the alliance betwixt the moulding
edge of two adjoining timbers, which must always contain the breadth of
two timbers; and sometimes two or three inches between them. It must be
observed, that one mould serves for two timbers; the fore side of the one
being supposed to unite with the after side of the other, and so make only one
line; which is actually the case in all the frames, which in some ships are every
third, and in others every fourth timber. The frames are first put up,
and fastened to the ribbands, and afterwards the others are put up, which
are called fitting-timbers. <cite>Murray’s ship-building.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>TIMONEER, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">timonier</span></i>, Fr.) the helmsman, or person who manages the
helm to direct the ship’s course. See the article <span class='sc'>Steering</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a ship of war the quarter-masters and timoneers are usually chosen by the
master, to <i>cun</i> and steer the ship; as also, to stow the provisions in the hold,
coil the cables, regulate the watch, &amp;c. See <span class='sc'>Quarter-master</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TOGETHER! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accord</span></i>, the order given to the men in the exercises of
<i>heaving</i>, rowing, holding, &amp;c. to act all in concert, or at the same instant.</p>

<p class='c008'>TOGGEL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabillot</span></i>, a small wooden pin, about five or six inches in length,
and usually tapering from the middle towards the extremities. It is used to
fix transversely in the lower part of a tackle, in which it serves as an hook
whereby to attach the tackle to a strop, slings, or any body whereon the effort
of the tackle is to be employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are also toggels of another kind, employed to fasten the top-gallant
sheets to the <i>span</i>, which is knotted round the cap at the top-mast-head.
For as the lifts of the topsail-yard are out of use when the topsail is hoisted,
they are always converted into top-gallant sheets, to render the rigging at the
mast-heads as light and simple as possible. Before the topsail-yards can be
lowered so as to be sustained by their lifts, it therefore becomes necessary to
transfer that part of the lift to the top-mast-head, that so the whole weight
of the yard may be sustained by its mast-head, and no part thereof by the
top-gallant-yard, which would otherwise be the case. This is performed by
fixing the double part, or bight of the lift, within the eye of the span above
mentioned, and inserting the toggel through the former, so as to confine it
to the latter, which operation is amongst sailors called putting the sheets in
the <i>beckets</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TOMPION, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tampon</span></i>, Fr.) a sort of bung or cork used to stop the mouth
of a cannon. At sea this is carefully encircled with tallow or putty, to prevent
the penetration of the water into the bore, whereby the powder contained
in the chamber might be damaged or rendered incapable of service.</p>

<p class='c008'>TONNAGE. See the article <span class='sc'>Burthen</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TOP, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hune</span></i>, a sort of platform, surrounding the lower mast-head, from
which it projects on all sides like a scaffold.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal intention of the top is to extend the top-mast shrouds, so as
to form a greater angle with the mast, and thereby give additional support to
the latter. It is sustained by certain timbers fixed across the <i>hounds</i> or shoulders
of the mast, and called the tressel-trees and cross-trees, the former of
which are expressed by <i>k</i>, fig. 1. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. and the latter by <i>l, l</i>, fig. 2. The
plan of the top is represented in fig. 6. where <i>g g</i> represents the holes through
which the top-mast shrouds communicate with those of the lower mast, as explained
in the article <span class='sc'>Shroud</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the use above mentioned, the top is otherwise extremely convenient
to contain the materials necessary for extending the small sails, and for fixing or
repairing the rigging and machinery, with more facility and expedition. In
ships of war it is used as a kind of redoubt, and is accordingly fortified for
attack or defence, being furnished with swivels, musketry, and other fire-arms;
and guarded by a thick fence of corded <i>hammocs</i>. Finally, it is employed
as a place for looking out, either in the day or night.</p>

<p class='c008'>The frame of the top is either close-planked like a platform, or open like
a grating. The former kind, which is exhibited in fig. 6. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. is generally
stronger and more convenient; but the latter is much better in tempestuous
weather, as presenting a smaller surface to the wind when the ship leans
over to one side, and by consequence being less exposed to its efforts.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all ships of war, and in the largest merchantmen, the top is fenced on
the aft-side by a rail of about three feet high, stretching across, and supported
by stanchions, between which a netting is usually constructed, as appears
by fig. 2. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>. The outside of this netting is generally covered with
red bayze or red painted canvas, which is extended from the rail down to the
edge of the top, and called the top-armour. By this name it seems to have
been considered as a sort of blind, behind which the men may conceal themselves
from the aims of the enemy’s fire-arms in time of action, whilst they
are charging their own muskets, carabines, or swivels.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dimensions of tops in the royal navy are as follow. The breadth of
the top <i>athwart-ships</i>, <i>q q</i>, fig. 6. is one third of the length of its corresponding
top-mast. The length of all tops, from the foremost to the after edge
<i>p p</i>, is equal to three fourths of their breadth athwart; and the square hole in
the middle is five inches to a foot of those dimensions. The tressel-trees and
cross-trees extend nearly to the edge of the tops. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Top-lanthorn</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fanal de hune</span></i>, a large lanthorn placed in the after part of
the top, in any ship where an admiral or commodore is personally aboard. It
is supported on each side by iron braces <i>r</i>, as expressed in fig. 3. plate <a href='#VI'>VI</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Top-mast</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mât de hune</span></i>, the second division of a mast; or that part which
stands between the upper and lower pieces. See the article <span class='sc'>Mast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Top-rope</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guinderesse</span></i>, a rope employed to <i>sway-up</i> a top-mast or top-gallant
mast, in order to fix it in its place; or to lower it in tempestuous weather, or
when it is no longer necessary. The rope used on this occasion for the top-masts
is, on account of their great weight, furnished with an assemblage of pullies,
at its lower end, called the <i>top-tackle</i>, to hoist or lower the mast with greater
facility. The whole of this is particularly explained in the article <span class='sc'>Mast</span>,
and the plate therein referred to.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Top-sails</span>, certain large sails extended across the top-masts, by the top-sail-yard
above, and by the yard attached to the lower mast beneath; being
fastened to the former by <i>robands</i>, and to the latter by means of two great blocks
fixed on its extremities, through which the topsail-sheets are inserted, passing
from thence to two other blocks fixed on the inner part of the yard close
by the mast: and from these latter the sheets lead downwards to the deck,
where they may be slackened or extended at pleasure. See the article <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.
<i>N. B.</i> The top-gallant sails are expanded above the topsail-yard, in the same
manner as the latter are extended above the lower yard.</p>

<p class='c008'>The several parts of the machinery by which the top-sails are managed, as
the <i>bowlines</i>, <i>braces</i>, <i>haliards</i>, <i>lifts</i>, and <i>sheets</i>, being copiously defined in
their proper places, it would be superfluous to repeat their explanations.</p>

<p class='c008'>TOPPING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apiquer</span></i>, the act of pulling one of the extremities of a yard
higher than the other, by slackening one of the <i>lifts</i>, and pulling upon the
opposite one, so as to place the yard at a greater or lesser obliquity with the
mast.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Topping-lift</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balancine de gui</span></i>, a large and strong tackle, employed to
suspend or <i>top</i> the outer end of a gaff, or of the <i>boom</i> of a main-sail and fore-sail;
such as are used in <i>brigs</i>, <i>sloops</i>, or <i>schooners</i>. See <span class='sc'>Square</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TORNADO, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">travade</span></i>, a violent squall or gust of wind rising suddenly from
the shore, and afterwards veering round the compass like a hurricane. These
are very frequent on the coasts of Guinea and South Barbary. See <span class='sc'>Wind</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TOUCHING, the state of a ship’s sails when they first begin to shiver,
with their edges in the direction of the wind. It is either occasioned by a sudden
alteration of the ship’s course, or by a change of the wind, in which it
blows more obliquely along the surface of the sails, instead of falling into
their cavities from behind, according to its usual direction. See <span class='sc'>Full and
by</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Touching-at</span>, implies the circumstance of stopping, or anchoring occasionally,
at some intermediate port, in the course of a voyage.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> TOW, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">remorquer</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">teon</span></i>, <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">teohan</span></i>, Sax.) to draw a ship forward in the
water, by means of a rope attached to another vessel or boat, which advances
by the effort of rowing or sailing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Towing is either practised when a ship is disabled, and rendered incapable
of carrying sail at sea; or when her sails are not fixed upon the masts, as in a
harbour: or when they are deprived of their force of action by a cessation
of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship of war is dismasted, or otherwise disabled from carrying sail
at sea, she is usually towed by a cable reaching from her bow to another ship
a-head. In a harbour towing is practised by one or more boats, wherein all
the force of the oars are exerted to make her advance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tow-line</span>, a small hauser generally used to remove a ship from one part
of an harbour or road to another, by means of anchors, capsterns, &amp;c. as
explained in the article <span class='sc'>Warping</span>. It is also employed occasionally to moor
a small vessel in a harbour, conveniently sheltered from the wind and sea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tow-rope</span>, a name given to any cable or other rope used in the exercise
of towing.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRACING-LINE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">martinet</span></i>, a small cord generally passing through a
block or <i>thimble</i>, and used to hoist up any object to a higher station, in order
to render it less inconvenient. Such are the tracing-lines of the <i>awnings</i>, and
those of the <i>yard-tackles</i>, which, by hanging down in a cavity or bight, would
be aukward and incommodious.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRACK <i>of a ship</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Wake</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRACKING, the act of pulling any vessel or floating body along the
stream of a canal or river, by means of a rope extending from the vessel, &amp;c.
to the adjacent shore, and drawn along the banks of the river, by men or horses.
Whence,</p>

<p class='c008'>TRACK-SCOUT, a vessel employed to carry goods or passengers up and
down the rivers or canals in Holland, and the countries bordering on the
Baltic sea. It is usually tracked by a horse, who trots along the margin to a
limited distance, after which he is relieved by another.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRADE-WINDS, certain regular winds blowing within or near the tropics,
and being either periodical or perpetual. Thus, in the Indian ocean,
they blow alternately from different points of the compass, during a limited
season; and, in the Atlantic ocean, continue almost without intermission in
the same direction. They are accordingly called trade-winds, from their great
utility in navigation and commerce. See <span class='sc'>Monsoon</span> and <span class='sc'>Wind</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRAIN. See the articles <span class='sc'>Cannon</span> and <span class='sc'>Fire-ship</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRANSOMS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barres d’arcasse</span></i>, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">transenna</span></i>, Lat.) certain beams or timbers
extended across the <i>stern-post</i> of a ship, to fortify her after-part, and give it
the figure most suitable to the service for which she is calculated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Transoms are here defined <i>beams</i> or <i>timbers</i>, because they partake equally
of the form and purpose of those pieces. Thus the deck-transom is the aftmost
or hindmost beam of the lower deck, whereon all the deck-planks are
rabetted: and all the transoms are fixed athwart the stern-post, in the same
manner as the floor-timbers are laid upon the keel. As the floor-timbers also,
with regard to their general form and arrangement, have a <i>rising</i>, by which,
the bottom becomes narrower as it ascends towards the extremities; so the
arms of the transoms, being gradually closer in proportion to their distance
from the wing-transom downwards, give a similar figure to that part of the
ship, which accordingly becomes extremely narrow, from the counter towards
the keel; and this general figure or curve is called the <i>flight</i> of the transoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although these pieces are therefore extremely different in their figures, according
to the extent of the angles formed by their branches or horns, each of
them has nevertheless a double curve, which is partly vertical, and partly horizontal,
with regard to its situation in the ship. The former of these is
called, by the artificers, the round-up, and the latter the <i>round-aft</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the transoms fill up the whole space comprehended between the head of
the stern-post above, and the aftmost floor-timbers below, it is necessary to
distinguish them by particular names. Thus the highest is called the wing-transom:
the next, the deck-transom; and afterwards follow the first, second,
and third transoms; together with the intermediate ones, as represented
in fig. 1. plate <a href='#X'>X</a>. and described in the explanation thereof.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vertical direction of the arms or angles of the transoms, with regard
to the ship’s length, are expressed in the plane of <span class='sc'>Elevation</span>; and their horizontal
curves are also delineated on the plane of Projection; both of
which are represented under those terms in plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. and described in the general
explanation of the planes in the article <i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The highest transoms are connected to the ship’s quarter by knees, which
are bolted to those pieces, and to the after-timbers. See the article
<span class='sc'>Sleepers</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRANSPORT. See the article <span class='sc'>Ship</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRANSPORTING, the act of removing a ship from one place to another,
by the help of anchors and ropes. See <span class='sc'>Warping</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRAVELLER, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">racambeau</span></i>, a sort of <i>thimble</i>, whose diameter is much
longer, in proportion to the breadth of its surface, than the common ones,
fig. 3. plate <a href='#XII'>XII</a>. It is furnished with a tail formed of a piece of rope, about
three feet in length, one end of which encircles the ring, to which it is <i>spliced</i>.
These machines are principally intended to facilitate the <i>hoisting</i> or <i>lowering</i> of
the top-gallant-yards at sea: for which purpose two of them are fixed on each
<i>back-stay</i>, whereon they slide upwards and downwards, like the ring of a curtain
upon its rod: being thus attached to the extremities of the top-gallant-yard,
they prevent it from swinging backwards and forwards, by the agitation
of the ship, whilst the yard is hoisting or lowering at sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRAVERSE, in navigation, implies a compound course, or an assemblage
of various courses, lying at different angles with the meridian. Thus
fig. 2. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. exhibits the traverses formed by a ship, when making an oblique
progression against the direction of the wind, as explained in the article
<span class='sc'>Tacking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The true course and distance resulting from this diversity of courses is discovered
by collecting the difference of latitude and departure of each course,
and reducing the whole into one departure and one difference of latitude, according
to the known rules of trigonometry. This reduction will immediately
ascertain the base and perpendicular; or, in other words, will give the difference
of latitude and departure to discover the course and distance. See
<span class='sc'>Navigation</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Traverse-board</span>, a thin circular piece of board, marked with all the
points of the compass, and having eight holes bored in each, and eight small
pegs hanging from the center of the board. It is used to determine the different
courses run by a ship during the period of the watch; and to ascertain
the distance of each course. This implement is particularly useful in light
and variable winds, at which time the helmsman marks the course every half
hour, by fixing a peg in that point of the compass whereon the ship had advanced.
Thus, if the wind is northerly at the beginning of the watch, the
ship, being <i>close-hauled</i> on the larboard <i>tack</i>, will steer W. N. W. If, after
the first half hour, the wind changes to N. <i>by</i> W. the ship will fall off to W.
<i>by</i> N. both of these courses are marked by the helmsman upon the traverse-board,
by putting in one peg for every half hour on which she steers the
same course; as, one peg into W. N. W. and two pegs into W. <i>by</i> N. if she
sails an hour on the latter course; and so on. The lee-way and variation of
the compass are afterwards allowed by the pilot, on summing up the whole.</p>

<p class='c008'>TREE-NAILS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gournables</span></i>, certain long cylindrical wooden pins, employed
to connect the planks of a ship’s side and bottom to the corresponding
timbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tree-nails are justly esteemed superior to spike-nails or bolts, which are
liable to rust, and loosen, as well as to rot the timber; but it is necessary that
the oak of which they are formed should be solid, close, and replete with
gum, to prevent them from breaking and rotting in the ship’s frame. They
ought also to be well dried, so as to fill their holes when they are swelled with
moisture. They have usually one inch in thickness to 100 feet in the vessel’s
length; so that the tree-nails of a ship of 100 feet long, are one inch in diameter;
and one inch and a half for a ship of 150 feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRESTLE-TREES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tesseaux</span></i>, two strong bars of timber fixed horizontally
on the opposite sides of the lower mast-head, to support the frame of the
top, and the weight of the top-mast. See <span class='sc'>Mast</span> and <span class='sc'>Top</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRIM, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manege du navire</span></i>, (<i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">trimman</span></i>, Sax. <i>to build</i>) implies, in general, the
state or disposition by which a ship is best calculated for the several purposes
of navigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the trim of the <i>hold</i> denotes the most convenient and proper arrangement
of the various materials contained therein, relatively to the ships motion
or stability at sea. The trim of the masts and sails is also their most apposite
situation, with regard to the construction of the ship, and the effort of the
wind upon her sails.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the <i>stowage</i> of the hold, or the disposition of the several articles of the
cargo, considerably affects the ship’s motion and stability, it will be necessary
to give a general idea of the action of a heavy body upon the fluid that supports
it, and the re-action of the fluid on the floating body.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole weight of any body, then, may be considered as united in its
center of gravity; so that, if it were suspended by a line fastened to this center,
the line would hang in a perpendicular position, as directed through the center
of gravity to the center of the earth. A body which floats in a fluid is not,
however, supported by its center of gravity, but by the compression of the
surrounding filaments of water: and each of these, being considered as infinitely
small, will act upon a very minute portion of the surface of the floating body,
with regard to the specific gravity, and conform to a principle applicable
to all fluids, in proportion to the height of these filaments, viz. That
the weight of a column of any fluid will be in proportion to the specific
gravity of the fluid and the height of the column multiplied by its base.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as heavy bodies endeavour, by their gravity, to approach the center of
the earth, in a vertical line passing through their centers; so the pressure of
fluids endeavours to carry bodies in a vertical, tending from the center of
the earth towards their surface, and passing through the center of gravity of
the submerged part, which forces them towards the surface. So, in any submerged
body at rest, these two opposite forces coincide in the same vertical,
acting in a direction quite contrary to each other. <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bouguer’s Traité du navire.</span></cite></p>

<p class='c008'>From this theory it results, that the stability or trim of a ship chiefly depends
upon her construction, as considering the bottom to be homogeneous. This,
however, can only happen when her cargo consists of the same materials
throughout, as with corn, salt, or any species stowed in bulk, and when her
hold is entirely filled. For if the ship has not sufficient breadth to resist
the effort of the wind upon her sails; or if she is built too high, or too sharp
in the floor, her center of gravity will be too high, and she will be very <i>crank</i>,
i. e. apt to overturn.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as the <i>stiffness</i> of a ship, or quality to carry sail without danger of overturning,
depends very much on the <i>stowage</i> of the hold, the center of gravity
may thereby be considerably lowered, by which her stability will be increased
in proportion. It is a general maxim amongst mariners, that a ship will not
carry sufficient sail till she is laden so deep that the surface of the water may
glance on her extreme breadth <i>amidships</i>. She must therefore have a great deal
of weight, as ballast, &amp;c. to bring her to this situation, which is called a
good sailing trim.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several circumstances are also to be particularly considered with regard to
the quality, weight, and stowage of the ballast. The center of gravity being
placed too high, will render the ship incapable of carrying a sufficient
quantity of sail; and by having it too low, she will be in danger of rolling away
her masts. When it is placed too far forward, the ship will <i>pitch</i>, and <i>labour</i>
heavily; and when too far aft, she will occasionally be exposed to the dangerous
circumstance of a <i>pooping</i> sea. These extremes being carefully avoided, it remains
to proportion the contents of every part of the <i>hold</i> to its capacity, and
to place the lightest materials uppermost. See <span class='sc'>Stowage</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Trim</span>, when applied to the sails, denotes the general arrangement which is
best calculated to accelerate the ship’s course, according to the direction of the
wind. See the article <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the ship were always to sail before the wind, it would be a very simple
operation to trim the sails; because nothing else could be required than to dispose
them so as to receive the greatest possible effort of the wind, which is
evidently performed by arranging them at right angles with its direction. But,
when the current of wind acts more directly upon the ship’s side, it necessarily
falls more obliquely on the surface of the sails, so as to diminish their effort
to push the ship forward; and to augment their tendency to make her
incline to one side. Hence we may conclude, that an increase of the wind,
when accompanied with a variation unfavourable to the ship’s course, will by
no means augment her velocity; because the force previously employed to
push her forward, will afterwards operate to overturn her; and because this
impression renders it necessary to reduce the quantity of sail; the effort of
which is farther diminished by the obliquity of the action of the wind upon
its surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this theory it appears, that the effect of the wind to advance the ship
decreases in proportion to its obliquity with any sail upon which it operates.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mechanical disposition of the sails, according to every direction of the
wind upon their surfaces, is copiously described in the articles <span class='sc'>Close-hauled</span>,
<span class='sc'>Large</span>, <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>, and <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Trim</span>, when expressed of the masts, denotes their position with regard to
the ship and to each other. Thus, in the latter sense, they should neither
be too near nor too far apart; and, in the former, they should not be too
far forward or aft; and, according to the situation or quality which communicates
a greater velocity to the vessel, they should either be upright, or inclining
aft, or forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>TROUGH, a name given to the hollow, or interval between two high
waves, which resembles a broad and deep trench perpetually fluctuating. As
the <i>setting</i> of the sea is always produced by the wind, it is evident that the
waves, and consequently the trough or hollow space between them, will be
at right angles with the direction of the wind. Hence a ship rolls heaviest
when she lies in the trough of the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>TROWSERS, a sort of loose breeches of canvas worn by common

<p class='c008'>TRUCK, a piece of wood, which is either conical, cylindrical, spherical,
or spheroidical.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the trucks fixed on the spindle of a mast-head, and which are otherwise
called <i>acorns</i>, are in the form of a cone: and those which are employed as
wheels to the gun-carriages are cylinders. The trucks of the parrels assume
the figure of a globe; and, lastly, those of the flag-staffs resemble an
oblate spheroid. See the articles <span class='sc'>Acorn</span>, <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>, <span class='sc'>Parrel</span>, and <span class='sc'>Flag-staff</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Trucks of the shrouds are nearly similar to those of the parrels: they are
fastened to the shrouds about twelve or fourteen feet above the deck, the
hole in the middle being placed perpendicularly to contain some rope which
passes through it. The intention of these is to guide the sailors to the particular
rope, which might otherwise be easily mistaken for some other of the same

<p class='c008'><i>Speaking</i>-TRUMPET, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trompette marine</span></i>, a trumpet of brass or tin used at

<p class='c008'>TRUSS, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trousse</span></i>, Fr.) a machine employed to pull a yard home to its respective
mast, and retain it firmly in that position.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the truss is generally used instead of a parrel, it is rarely employed, except
in flying top-gallant-sails, which are never furnished with parrels. It is
no other than a ring or traveller, which encircles the mast, and has a rope
fastened to its after-part, leading downward to the top or decks; by means of
which the truss may be straitened or slackened at pleasure. The <i>haliards</i> of
the top-gallant-sail being passed through this ring; and the sail being hoisted
up to its utmost extent; it is evident, that the yard will be drawn close to the
mast, by pulling down the truss close to the upper part of the sail. For,
without the truss, the sail and its yard would be blown from the mast, so as
to swing about, by the action of the wind, and the rocking of the vessel;
unless the yard were hoisted close up to the pulley wherein the haliards run;
which seldom is the case in flying top-gallant-sails, because they are usually
much shallower than those which are fixed or <i>standing</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Truss-parrel.</span> See <span class='sc'>Parrel</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TRYING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la cape</span></i>, the situation in which a ship lies nearly in the
<i>trough</i> or hollow of the sea in a tempest, particularly when it blows contrary
to her course.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>trying</i>, as well as in <i>scudding</i>, the sails are always reduced in proportion
to the increase of the storm. Thus, in the former state, a ship may lie
by the wind under a whole main-sail, a whole fore-sail, or a whole mizen;
or under any of those sails, when diminished by the <i>reef</i> or <i>balance</i>. As the
least possible quantity of sail used in scudding are the <i>goose-wings</i> of the foresail;
so in <i>trying</i>, the smallest portion is generally the mizen-staysail or main-staysail:
and in either state, if the storm is excessive, she may lie with all
the sails furled, or, according to the sea-phrase, <i>under bare poles</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The intent of spreading a sail at this time is to keep the ship more steddy,
and, by pressing her side down in the water, to prevent her from rolling violently;
and also to turn her <i>bow</i> towards the direction of the wind, so that the
shock of the waves may fall more obliquely on her flank, than when she lies
along the trough of the sea. While she remains in this situation, the helm is
fastened close to the lee-side, or, in the sea-language, <i>hard a-lee</i>, to prevent
her as much as possible from falling-off. But as the ship is not then kept in
equilibrio by the effort of her sails, which at other times counterbalance each
other at the <i>head</i> and <i>stern</i>, she is moved by a slow but continual vibration,
which turns her head alternately to windward and to leeward, forming an
angle of three or four points in the interval. That part where she stops, in
approaching the direction of the wind, is called her <i>coming-to</i>, and the contrary
excess of the angle <i>to leeward</i> is termed her <i>falling-off</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, suppose the wind northerly, and a ship trying with her starboard
side to windward: if, in turning her head towards the source of the wind,
she arrives at N. W. ½ N. or N. 39° W. and then declines to the leeward
as far W. ½ S. or S. 84° W, the former will be called her coming-to, and
the latter her falling-off. In this position she advances very little according
to the line of her length, but is driven considerably to leeward, as described
in the articles <span class='sc'>Drift</span> and <span class='sc'>Lee-way</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TUCK, a name given to that part of the ship where the ends of the bottom-planks
are collected together immediately under the stern or counter.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this part, instead of being incurvated, and forming a convex surface,
assumes the shape of a vertical or oblique plane, it is said to be square, as represented
in fig. 8. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. A square tuck is accordingly terminated above
by the wing-<i>transom</i>, and below and on each side by the <i>fashion-pieces</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TUMBLING-HOME, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encabanement</span></i>, that part of a ship’s side which
falls inward above the extreme breadth, so as to make the ship gradually
narrower from the lower deck upwards. This angle is represented in general
throughout all the timbers in the plane of <i>projection</i>, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. It is also
more particularly expressed by Q T in the <span class='sc'>Midship-frame</span>, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>.
where it is evident, that the ship grows narrower from Q towards T. N. B.
In all our old sea-books, this narrowing of a ship from the extreme breadth
upwards is called housing-in. See <span class='sc'>Upper-work</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>TURNING-<i>to-windward</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chicaner le vent</span></i>, that operation in sailing wherein
a ship endeavours to make a progress against the direction of the wind,

<p class='c008'>The tye is either passed through a block fixed to the mast-head, and afterwards
through another block moveable upon the yard or gaff intended to

<p class='c008'>VANE, a thin slip of bunting hung to the mast-head, or some other conspicuous

<p class='c008'><i>Dog</i>-<span class='sc'>Vane</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">panon</span></i>, a small light vane, formed of a piece of packthread
about two feet in length, upon which are fixed five or six thin slices of cork
stuck full of light feathers. It is usually fastened to the top of a staff two
yards high, which is placed on the top of the ship’s side on the quarter-deck,
in order to shew the direction of the wind to the helmsman, particularly in a
dark night, or when the wind is extremely feeble.</p>

<p class='c008'>VANGS, a sort of <i>braces</i> to support the mizen <i>gaff</i>, and keep it steddy.
They are fixed on the outer-end or <i>peek</i>, and reach downwards to the aftmost

when the wind is <i>fair</i>; and drawn in to windward when it becomes unfavourable
to the ship’s course.</p>

<p class='c008'>VARIATION, the angle contained between the true meridian and the
magnetic meridian.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘After the discovery of that most useful property of the magnet, or loadstone,
namely, the giving hardened iron and steel a polarity, the compass
was for many years used without knowing that its direction in any wise deviated
from the poles of the world: and about the middle of the 16th century,
so certain were some of its inflexibly pointing to the north, that they
treated with contempt the notion of the variation, which about that time began
to be suspected<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a>. However, careful observations soon discovered, that
in England, and its neighbourhood, the needle pointed to the eastward of
the true north: but the quantity of this deviation being known, mariners
became as well satisfied as if the compass had none; because they imagined
that the true course could be obtained by making allowance for the true variation.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘From successive observations made afterwards, it was found, that the
deviation of the needle from the north was not a constant quantity; but that
it gradually diminished, and at last, about the year 1660, it was found at
London that the needle pointed due north, and has ever since been getting
to the westward, and now the variation is more than 20 degrees to the westward
of the north: so that in any one place it may be suspected the variation
has a kind of libratory motion, traversing through the north to unknown
limits eastward and westward. But the settling of this point must be left to
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘During the time of the said observations it was also discovered, that the
variation of the needle was different in different parts of the world, it being
west in some places when it was east in others; and in places where the variation
was of the same name, yet the quantity of it greatly differed. It was
therefore found necessary, that mariners should every day, or as often as they
had opportunity, make, during their voyage, proper observations for an amplitude
or azimuth; whereby they might be enabled to find the variation
of the compass in their present place, and thence correct their courses.’ <cite>Robertson’s
Elements of navigation.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Halley published, in the last century, a theory of the variations of the
compass. In this work he supposes there are four magnetic poles in the
earth, two of which are fixed and two moveable, by which he explains the different
variation of the compass, at different times, in the same place. But it
is impossible to apply exact calculations to so complicated an hypothesis.
M. Euler, son of the celebrated geometrician of that name, has however
shewn, that two magnetic poles placed on the surface of the earth will sufficiently
account for the singular figure assumed by the lines which pass
through all the points of equal variation in the chart of Dr. Halley.</p>

<p class='c008'>M. Euler first examines the case, wherein the two magnetic poles are diametrically
opposite; 2d. he places them in the two opposite meridians, but
at unequal distances from the poles of the world; 3d. he places them in
the same meridian. Finally, he considers them situated in two different
meridians. These four cases may become equally important; because, if it is
determined that there are only two magnetic poles, and that these poles change
their situations, it may some time hereafter be discovered that they pass
through all the different positions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since the needle of the compass ought always to be in the plane which
passes through the place of observation and the two magnetic poles, the problem
is reduced to the discovery of the angle contained between this plane
and the plane of the meridian. M. Euler, after having examined the different
cases, finds, that they also express the earth’s magnetism, represented in the
chart published by Mess. Mountaine and Dodson in 1744, particularly
throughout Europe and North America, if the following principles are established.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between the Arctic pole and the magnetic pole 14° 53´.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between the Antarctic pole and the other magnetic pole 29° 23´.</p>

<p class='c008'>53° 18´ The angle at the north pole, formed by the meridians passing
through the two magnetic poles.</p>

<p class='c008'>250° The longitude of the meridian, which passes over the northern magnetic
pole.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the observations which have been collected with regard to the variation
are, for the most part, loose and inaccurate, it is impossible to represent them
all with precision; and the great variations observed in the Indian ocean,
seem to require, says M. Euler, that the three first quantities should be
14, 35, and 63 degrees. In the mean time, the general agreement is sufficiently
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c008'>The high reputation of Dr. Halley’s magnetical chart renders it more particularly
necessary to point out the errors contained therein<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a>. There is evidently
too little distance between the lines of no variation, of which one crosses the
equator 17° westward of London, and the other 119° to the eastward. This
makes 136 degrees only; whereas it should necessarily exceed 180 and
even 200, inasmuch as the pole of the world is supposed farther distant from
the magnetic pole towards the south than in the north, as is required by the
other phænomena. Again, upon the coasts discovered by <i>Diemen</i>, there was
no variation in 1642; and Dr. Halley also supposes there was none in 1700.
Meanwhile, by the alteration observed at Paris, the line of no variation
should be advanced 60° towards the south, which will agree better with the
calculations, and prove that the distance of the two intersections was really
greater than Dr. Halley had established.</p>

<p class='c008'>The table of variation of Mess. Mountaine and Dodson is accompanied with
several interesting particulars, which equally deserve to be inserted here.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Barbadoes, (says Capt. Snow) the variation seems very nearly at a
stand; for in the road I observed 5° east; and by Dr. Halley’s draught, in the
year 1701, 5½ degrees. In 1747, at Port Royal keys, Jamaica, I observed
the variation 7° 20´ E.; and on the coast of Carthagena, the same week,
off the high land of Santa Martha, 7° 45´ nearly south of Port Royal.
Therefore these curves are not much altered: the curve at Jamaica is nearly
at a stand, as though tied, and the south part of them with the rest dropping
to the westward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the equator, in longitude 40° E. from London, the highest variation
during the whole fifty-six years appears to be 17°¼ W. and the least
16°½ W.: and in latitude 15° N. longitude 60° W. from London, the
variation has been constantly 5° E.: but in other places the case has been
widely different. For in the latitude of 10° S. longitude 60° E. from London,
the variation has decreased from 17° W. to 7°¼ W.; and in latitude
10° S. longitude 5° W. from London, from 2°¼ W. to 12°¾ W.; and in
latitude 15° N. longitude 20°, it has increased from 1° W. to 9° W.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there is still a more extraordinary appearance in the Indian seas. For
instance, under the equator:</p>

<p class='c008'>Where the west variation, in the longitude 40° E. is the same in  both the
above years; and in 1700 the west variation seemed to be regularly decreasing
from longitude 50° E. to the longitude 100° E.; but in 1756, we find
the west variation decreasing so fast, that we have east variation in the longitude
80°, 85°, and 90° E.; and yet in the longitude 95° and 100° E. we
have west variation again. <cite>Philosophical Transactions for the year 1757.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>To these remarks may be subjoined the following extracts from the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Exposition
du calcul astronomique</span></cite>, by <i>M. de la Lande</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the royal observatory in Paris, a magnetical needle of four inches deviated
from the N. 18° 10´ towards the west, on the 15th of February
1759: and on the 22d of April 1760, the same needle varied 18° 20´. It is
indeed natural to conceive, that nothing can be precisely ascertained by ten
minutes upon a circle whose diameter is only four inches. It is nevertheless
sufficiently evident, that this variation continues to increase at Paris.
In 1610 the needle declined 8° towards the east, so that the variation has
changed 26° 20´ in the space of 150 years; and this appears particularly since
1740: for the same needle, which has always been used by M. Maraldi, is
more than 3° advanced towards the west, beyond what it was at that period;
and this makes 9´ in one year.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> VEER <i>and haul</i>, to pull a rope tight, by drawing it in and slackening
it alternately, till the body to which it is applied acquires an additional
motion, like the increased vibrations of a pendulum, so that the rope is
straitened to a greater tension with more facility and dispatch. This method
is particularly used in hauling the <i>bowlines</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wind is said to veer and haul when it alters its direction, and becomes
more or less <i>fair</i>. Thus it is said to veer aft and to haul forward.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Veer</span> <i>away the cable</i>. See <span class='sc'>Cable</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>VEERING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">virer vent arriere</span></i>, the operation by which a ship, in changing
her course from one board to the other, turns her stern to windward. Hence
it is used in opposition to <i>tacking</i>, wherein the head is turned to the wind, and
the stern to <i>leeward</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the ship A, fig. 8. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. having made the necessary dispositions
to veer, <i>bears away</i> gradually before the wind, till it blows obliquely upon
the opposite side, which was formerly to leeward, as at <i>a</i>; and as the stern
necessarily yields to this impression of the wind, assisted by the force of the
helm, and the action of the waves upon the same quarter, the side which was
formerly to leeward soon becomes to windward, as in the point <i>a</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since, by this movement, a ship loses ground considerably more than by
tacking, it is rarely practised except in cases of necessity or delay: as, when
the violence of the wind and sea renders tacking impracticable; or when her
course is slackened to wait for a pilot, or some other ship in company, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been observed in the article <span class='sc'>Tacking</span>, <i>that the change of motion in
any body, will be in proportion to the moving force impressed, and made according
to the right line in which that force operates</i>. Hence it is evident, that veering
as well as tacking is a necessary consequence of the same invariable principle;
for as, in the latter, almost the whole force of the wind and of the helm are
exerted on the hind part of the ship, to turn the prow to windward; so, in
the former, the same impression, assisted by the efforts of the helm, falls upon
the prow, to push it to leeward; and the motion communicated to the ship
must in both cases necessarily conspire with the action of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, when it becomes necessary to veer the ship, the sails towards the
stern are either furled, or <i>brailed</i> up, and made to <i>shiver</i> in the wind; whilst
those near the head are spread abroad, so as to collect the whole current of
air which their surfaces can contain. Hence, while the whole force of the
wind is exerted on the fore part of the ship to turn her about, its effect is considerably
diminished, or altogether destroyed, on the surfaces of the after-sails.
The fore part accordingly yields to the above impulse, and is put in
motion; and this movement, conspiring with that of the wind, pushes the
ship about as much as is necessary to produce the effect required. When she
is turned so that the wind will act upon that quarter which was formerly to
leeward, as at the point <i>a</i>, fig. 8. her circular motion will be accelerated by
extending some of the sails near the stern, as the mizen, and by placing those
at the prow more obliquely, which will wheel the vessel round with her bow
to the windward; in the same situation, with regard to the wind, as when
<i>close-hauled</i>, or tacking.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the tempest is so violent as to prevent the use of sails, the effort of
the wind operates almost equally on the opposite ends of the ship, so that the
masts and yards situated at the head and stern counterbalance each other.
The effect of the helm is also considerably diminished, because the <i>head-way</i>,
which gives life and vigour to all its operations, is at this time feeble and ineffectual.
Hence it is necessary to defray this equilibrium which subsists between
the masts and yards <i>afore</i> and <i>abaft</i>, and to throw the balance forward,
in order to prepare for veering. This is accordingly performed by bracing
the foremost yards across the direction of the wind, and arranging those on the
main-mast and mizen mast directly in the line of the wind. If this expedient
proves unsuccessful, and it is absolutely necessary to veer, in order to save the
ship from destruction, by oversetting or running ashore, the mizen-mast must
instantly be cut away, and even the main-mast, if she yet remains incapable
of answering the helm by bearing away before the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>VENT. See the articles <i>Cannon</i> and <i>Windage</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>VESSEL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">batiment</span></i>, a general name given to the different sorts of ships
which are navigated on the ocean, or in canals and rivers. It is, however,
more particularly applied to those of the smaller kind, furnished with one or
two masts.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been remarked in the article <span class='sc'>Ship</span>, that the views of utility,
which ought always to be considered in a work of this kind, seemed to limit
our general account of shipping to those which are most frequently employed
in European navigation. We have therefore collected into one point of
view the principal of these in plate <a href='#XII'>XII</a>.; so that the reader who is unacquainted
with marine affairs, may the more easily perceive their distinguishing
characters, which are also more particularly described under the reflective
articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus fig. 4. plate <a href='#XII'>XII</a>. exhibits a snow under sail; fig. 5. represents a
ketch at anchor; fig. 6. a brig or brigantine; fig. 7. a bilander; fig. 8. a
xebec; fig. 9. a schooner; fig. 10. a galliot; fig. 11. a dogger; all of which
are under sail; fig. 12. &amp; 13. two galleys, one of which is under sail, and
the other rowing; and fig. 14. a sloop.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ketch, whose sails are furled, is furnished with a try-sail, like the
snow; and it has a fore-sail, fore-staysail, and jib, nearly similar to those of
a sloop; but the sails on the main-mast and mizen-mast are like those of a ship.
The main-sail and main-topsail of the brig are like those of the schooner; and
the fore-mast is rigged and equipped with sails in the same manner as the ship
and snow. The sails, masts, and yards of the xebec, being extremely different
from these, are described at large under the article. In the schooner both
the mainsail and foresail are extended by a <i>boom</i> and <i>gaff</i>, as likewise is the
sloop’s mainsail; the sails of the dogger and galliot are sufficiently expressed
in the plate; and, finally, the galleys are navigated with lateen-sails, which
are extremely different from those of the vessels above described.</p>

<p class='c008'>UNREEVING, the act of withdrawing or taking out a rope from any

<p class='c008'>VOYAL, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tournevire</span></i>, a large rope used to unmoor, or heave up the anchors
of a ship, by transmitting the effort of the <i>capstern</i> to the cables.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is performed by fastening one part of the voyal to the cable in several
places, and by winding another part thereof three or four times about the
capstern, which answers the same purpose as if the cable itself were in that
manner wound about the capstern; and the voyal being much lighter and
more pliant, is infinitely more convenient in this exercise. See the articles
<span class='sc'>Capstern</span> and <span class='sc'>Nipper</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the cable is drawn into the ship by the main capstern, the voyal is used
without any block: but if the capstern in the fore-part of the ship be employed
for this purpose, the voyal usually passes through a large block attached
to the main-mast; and thence communicates with the jear-capstern.</p>

<p class='c008'>UPPER-DECK, the highest of those decks which are continued throughout
the whole of a ship of war, or merchantman, without any interruption,
of steps or irregular ascents. See <span class='sc'>Deck</span> and <span class='sc'>Waist</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>UPPER-WORK, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oeuvres mortes</span></i>, a general name given to all that part of

she neither inclines to the right nor left, with regard to the vertical position of
her stem and stern-post.</p>

<p class='c008'>USES AND CUSTOMS <i>of the sea</i>; certain general principles which compose
the basis of marine jurisprudence, and regulate the affairs of commerce
and navigation.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>W.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>WAD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourrelet</span></i>, a quantity of old rope-yarns rolled firmly together into
the form of a ball, and used to confine the shot or shell, together with
its charge of powder, in the breech of a piece of artillery.</p>

<p class='c008'>M. Le Blond observes, in his Elements of war, that the wad is necessary to
retain the charge closely in the chamber of the cannon, so that it may not,
when fired, be dilated around the sides of the ball, by its <i>windage</i> as it passes
through the chace; a circumstance which would considerably diminish the
effort of the powder. But as the wad cannot be fastened to the sides of the
bore, it is carried away in the same instant when the charge is inflamed, and
that with so little resistance, that it cannot in any degree retard the explosion,
or give time for the entire inflammation of the powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>This reasoning may with equal propriety be applied to the wad that covers
the bullet; which, nevertheless, is absolutely requisite, to prevent it from
rolling out when the piece is fired horizontally or pointed downwards. Both
are therefore peculiarly necessary in naval engagements, because, without
being thus retained in its chamber, the shot would instantly roll out of the
chace by the agitation of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>WAFT, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">berne</span></i>, a signal displayed from the stern of a ship for some particular
purpose, by hoisting the ensign, furled up together into a long roll,
to the head of its staff. It is particularly used to summon the boats off from
the shore to the ship whereto they belong; or as a signal for a pilot to repair
aboard. See <span class='sc'>Signal</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>WAIST, that part of a ship which is contained between the quarter-deck
and fore-castle, being usually a hollow space, with an ascent of several steps
to either of those places.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the waist of a merchant-ship is only one or two steps of descent from
the quarter-deck and fore-castle, she is said to be galley-built; but when it is
considerably deeper, as with six or seven steps, she is called frigate-built.
See the articles <span class='sc'>Deck</span>, <span class='sc'>Deep-waisted</span>, and <span class='sc'>Frigate</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>WAKE, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">houaiche</span></i>, the print or track impressed by the course of a ship on the
surface of the water. It is formed by the re-union of the body of water,
which was separated by the ship’s bottom whilst moving through it and
may be seen to a considerable distance behind the stern, as smoother than the
rest of the sea. Hence it is usually observed by the compass, to discover the
angle of <span class='sc'>Lee-way</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship is said to be in the wake, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans l’eau</span></i>, of another, when she follows
her on the same track, or on a line supposed to be formed on the continuation
of her keel. Thus the ships <i>a</i> <i>b</i>, fig. 11. and <i>a</i> <i>b</i>, fig. 7. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. are
all in the wake of the foremost <i>b</i>. See the article <span class='sc'>Line</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two distant objects observed at sea are called in the <i>wake</i> of each other,
when the view of the farthest is intercepted by the nearest; so that the observer’s
eye and the two objects are all placed upon the same right line.</p>

<p class='c008'>WALE-KNOT, or WALL-KNOT, a particular sort of large knot raised
upon the end of a rope, by untwisting the <i>strands</i>, and interweaving them
amongst each other. See the article <span class='sc'>Knot</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>WALE-REARED, an obsolete phrase, implying <i>wall-sided</i>, which see.</p>

<p class='c008'>WALES, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">preceintes</span></i>, an assemblage of strong planks extending along a
ship’s side, throughout her whole length, at different heights, and serving to
reinforce the decks, and form the curves by which the vessel appears light
and graceful on the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the wales are framed of planks broader and thicker than the rest, they
resemble ranges of hoops encircling the sides and <i>bows</i>. They are usually distinguished
into the main-wale and the channel-wale; the breadth and thickness
of which are expressed by Q and R in the <span class='sc'>Midship-frame</span>, plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>.
and their length is exhibited in the <span class='sc'>Elevation</span>, plate <a href='#I'>I</a>. where L Q Z is
the main-wale, and D R X the channel-wale, parallel to the former.</p>

<p class='c008'>The situation of the wales, being ascertained by no invariable rule, is generally
submitted to the fancy and judgment of the builder. The position of
the gun-ports and scuppers ought, however, to be particularly considered on
this occasion, that the wales may not be wounded by too many breaches.</p>

<p class='c008'>WALL-SIDED, the figure of a ship’s side, when, instead of being incurvated
so as to become gradually narrower towards the <i>upper part</i>, it is
nearly perpendicular to the surface of the water, like a wall; and hence the
derivation of the phrase.</p>

<p class='c008'>WALT, an obsolete or spurious term signifying <i>crank</i>. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>WARP, a small rope employed occasionally to remove a ship from one
place to another, in a port, road, or river. And hence,</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Warp</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">remorquer</span></i>, is to change the situation of a ship, by pulling her
from one part of a harbour, &amp;c. to some other, by means of warps, which
are attached to buoys; to anchors sunk in the bottom; or to certain stations
upon the shore, as posts, rings, trees, &amp;c. The ship is accordingly drawn
forwards to those stations, either by pulling on the warps by hand, or by the
application of some purchase, as a tackle, windlass, or capstern, upon her
deck. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this operation is performed by the ship’s lesser anchors, these machines,
together with their warps, are carried out in the boats alternately
towards the place where the ship is endeavouring to arrive: so that when she
is drawn up close to one anchor, the other is carried out to a competent distance
before her, and being sunk, serves to fix the other warp by which she
is farther advanced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Warping is generally used when the sails are <i>unbent</i>, or when they cannot
be successfully employed, which may either arise from the unfavourable state
of the wind, the opposition of the tide, or the narrow limits of the channel.</p>

<p class='c008'>WASH. See the article <span class='sc'>Oar</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wash-board</span>, a broad thin plank fixed occasionally on the top of a boat’s
side, so as to continue the height thereof, and be removed at pleasure. It is
used to prevent the sea from breaking into the vessel, particularly when the
surface is rough, as in tempestuous weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>WATCH, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quart</span></i>, the space of time wherein one division of a ship’s crew
remains upon deck, to perform the necessary services, whilst the rest are relieved
from duty, either when the vessel is under sail, or at anchor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The length of the sea-watch is not equal in the shipping of different nations.
It is always kept four hours by our British seamen, if we except the
<i>dog</i>-watch between four and eight in the evening, that contains two reliefs,
each of which are only two hours on deck. The intent of this is to change the
period of the night-watch every twenty-four hours; so that the party watching
from eight till twelve in one night, shall watch from midnight till four in
the morning on the succeeding one. In France the duration of the watch is
extremely different, being in some places six hours, and in others seven or
eight; and in Turky and Barbary it is usually five or six hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ship’s company is usually classed into two parties; one of which is
called the starboard and the other the larboard watch. It is, however,
occasionally separated into three divisions, as in a <i>road</i> or in particular
voyages.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a ship of war the watch is generally commanded by a lieutenant, and in
merchant-ships by one of the mates; so that if there are four mates in the
latter, there are two in each watch; the first and third being in the larboard,
and the second and fourth in the starboard watch: but in the navy the officers
who command the watch usually divide themselves into three parts, in
order to lighten their duty.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Watch-glasses</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">horloge</span></i>, a name given to the glasses employed to measure
the period of the watch, or to divide it into any number of equal parts,
as hours, half-hours, &amp;c. so that the several stations therein may be regularly
kept and relieved; as at the <i>helm</i>, <i>pump</i>, <i>look-out</i>. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To set the</i> <span class='sc'>Watch</span>, is to appoint one division of the crew to enter upon
the duty of the watch; as at eight o’clock in the evening. Hence it is equivalent
to <i>mounting the guard</i> in the army. See the French term <span class='sc'>Bordée</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>WATER-BORNE, the state of a ship, with regard to the water surrounding
her bottom, when there is barely a sufficient depth of it to float her off
from the ground; particularly when she had for some time rested thereon.</p>

<p class='c008'>For <i>Dead</i>-<span class='sc'>Water</span>, <i>Foul</i> <span class='sc'>Water</span>, and <i>High</i>-<span class='sc'>Water</span>, see <span class='sc'>Dead</span>, <span class='sc'>Foul</span>,
and <span class='sc'>High</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Water-lines</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lignes d’eau</span></i>, certain horizontal lines supposed to be drawn
about the outside of a ship’s bottom, close to the surface of the water in
which she floats. They are accordingly higher or lower upon the bottom,
in proportion to the depth of the column of water required to float her.
See a particular account of these in the article <i>Naval</i> <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to conceive a clearer idea of the curves of those lines when represented
on a plane, let us suppose a ship laid <i>upright</i> on a level ground; so
that the keel shall lie in the same position, with respect to the horizon, as
when she is laden. We may then describe several black horizontal lines about
her bottom, which may be whitened for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a spectator is supposed to be placed, at a competent depth, under the
middle of her bottom, in a line perpendicular to the plane of the ground; he
will then, viewing the bottom upwards, discover the horizontal curves of all
the water-lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>These curves are all delineated on a plane, supposed to be formed by an
horizontal section of the bottom, at the height of the load-water-line, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ligne
d’eau du vaisseau chargé</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Water-logged</span>, the state of a ship when, by receiving a great quantity
of water into her hold, by leaking, &amp;c. she has become heavy and inactive
upon the sea, so as to yield without resistance to the efforts of every wave
rushing over her decks. As, in this dangerous situation, the center of gravity
is no longer fixed, but fluctuating from place to place, the stability of
the ship is utterly lost: she is therefore almost totally deprived of the use of
her sails, which would operate to overset her, or press the head under water.
Hence there is no resource for the crew, except to <i>free</i> her by the pumps,
or to abandon her by the boats as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Water-sail</span>, a small sail spread occasionally under the lower studding-sail,

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Water-spout</span>, an extraordinary and dangerous meteor, consisting of
a large mass of water, collected into a sort of column by the force of a whirlwind,
and moved with rapidity along the surface of the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>A variety of authors have written on the cause and effects of these meteors,
with different degrees of accuracy and probability. As it would be superfluous
to enter minutely into their various conjectures, which are frequently
grounded on erroneous principles, we shall content ourselves with selecting a
few of the latest remarks; and which are apparently supported by philosophical
reasoning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Franklin, in his physical and meteorological observations, supposes a
water-spout and a whirlwind to proceed from the same cause, their only difference
being, that the latter passes over the land, and the former over the
water. This opinion is corroborated by <i>M. de la Pryme</i>, in the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite>; where he describes two spouts observed at different times in
Yorkshire, whose appearances in the air were exactly like those of the spouts
at sea; and their effects the same as those of real whirlwinds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whirlwinds have generally a progressive as well as a circular motion; so
had what is called the spout at <i>Topsham</i>, described in the <cite>Transactions</cite>; and
this also by its effects appears to have been a real whirlwind. Water-spouts
have also a progressive motion, which is more or less rapid; being in some
violent, and in others barely perceptible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whirlwinds generally rise after calms and great heats: the same is observed
of water-spouts, which are therefore most frequent in the warm latitudes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wind blows every way from a large surrounding space to a whirlwind.
Three vessels employed in the whale-fishery, happening to be <i>becalmed</i>, lay
in sight of each other, at about a league distance, and in the form of a triangle.
After some time a water-spout appeared near the middle of the triangle;
when a brisk gale arose, and every vessel made sail. It then appeared
to them all by the <i>trimming</i> of their sails, and the course of each vessel,
that the spout was to leeward of every one of them; and this observation was
farther confirmed by the comparing of accounts, when the different observers
afterwards conferred about the subject. Hence whirlwinds and water-spouts
agree in this particular likewise.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the same meteor which appears a water-spout at sea, should, in its
progressive motion, encounter and pass over land, and there produce all the
phenomena and effects of a whirlwind, it would afford a stronger conviction
that a whirlwind and a water-spout are the same thing. An ingenious correspondent
of Dr. Franklin gives one instance of this that fell within his own
observation<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fluid moving from all points horizontally towards a center, must, at that
center, either mount or descend. If a hole be opened in the middle of the
bottom of a tub filled with water, the water will flow from all sides to the
center, and there descend in a whirl. But air flowing on or near the surface
of land or water, from all sides towards a center, must at that center ascend;
because the land or water will hinder its descent.</p>

<p class='c008'>If these concentring currents of air be in the upper region, they may indeed
descend in the spout or whirlwind; but then, when the united current
reached the earth or water, it would spread, and probably blow every way
from the center. There may be whirlwinds of both kinds; but from the
effects commonly observed, Dr. Franklin suspects the rising one to be most
frequent: when the upper air descends, it is perhaps in a greater body extending
wider, as in thunder-gusts, and without much whirling; and when
air descends in a spout or whirlwind, he conceives that it would rather press
the roof of a house <i>inwards</i>, or force in the tiles, shingles, or thatch, and
force a boat down into the water, or a piece of timber into the earth, than
snatch them upwards, and carry them away.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whirlwinds and spouts are not always, though most frequently, in the
day-time. The terrible whirlwind which damaged a great part of <i>Rome</i>,
June 11. 1749. happened in the night; and was supposed to have been previously
a water-spout, it being asserted as an undoubted fact, that it gathered
in the neighbouring sea, because it could be traced from Ostia to Rome.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whirlwind is said to have appeared as a very black, long, and lofty
cloud, discoverable, notwithstanding the darkness of the night, by its continually
lightening, or emitting flashes on all sides, pushing along with a surprising
swiftness, and within three or four feet of the ground. Its general effects
on houses were, stripping off the roofs, blowing away chimnies, breaking
doors and windows, <i>forcing up the floors, and unpaving the rooms</i>, (some of
these effects seem to agree well with a supposed vacuum in the center of the
whirlwind) and the very rafters of the houses were broke and dispersed, and
even hurled against houses at a considerable distance, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor, in proceeding to explain his conceptions, begs to be allowed
two or three positions, as a foundation for his hypothesis. 1. That the lower
region of air is often more heated, and so more rarified, than the upper; and
by consequence specifically lighter. The coldness of the upper region is manifested
by the hail, which sometimes falls from it in warm weather. 2. That
heated air may be very moist, and yet the moisture so equally diffused and
rarified as not to be visible till colder air mixes with it, at which time it condenses
and becomes visible. Thus our breath, although invisible in summer,
becomes visible in winter.</p>

<p class='c008'>These circumstances being granted, he presupposes a tract of land or sea,
of about sixty miles in extent, unsheltered by clouds and unrefreshed by
the wind, during a summer’s day, or perhaps for several days without intermission,
till it becomes violently heated, together with the lower region of
the air in contact with it, so that the latter becomes specifically lighter than
the superincumbent higher region of the atmosphere, wherein the clouds are
usually floated: he supposes also that the air surrounding this tract has not
been so much heated during those days, and therefore remains heavier. The
consequence of this, he conceives, should be, that the heated lighter air
should ascend, and the heavier descend; and as this rising cannot operate
throughout the whole tract at once, because that would leave too extensive a
vacuum, the rising will begin precisely in that column which happens to be
lighted, or most rarified; and the warm air will flow horizontally from all
parts to this column, where the several currents meeting, and joining to rise,
a whirl is naturally formed, in the same manner as a whirl is formed in a tub
of water, by the descending fluid receding from all sides of the tub towards
the hole in the center.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as the several currents arrive at this central rising column, with a considerable
degree of horizontal motion, they cannot suddenly change it to a vertical
motion; therefore, as they gradually, in approaching the whirl, decline
from right to curve or circular lines, so, having joined the whirl, they ascend
by a spiral motion; in the same manner as the water descends spirally through
the hole in the tub before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, as the lower air nearest the surface is more rarified by the heat of the
sun, it is more impressed by the current of the surrounding cold and heavy air
which is to assume its place, and consequently its motion towards the whirl
is swiftest, and so the force of the lower part of the whirl strongest, and the
centrifugal force of its particles greatest. Hence the vacuum which encloses
the axis of the whirl should be greatest near the earth or sea, and diminish
gradually as it approaches the region of the clouds, till it ends in a point.</p>

<p class='c008'>This circle is of various diameters, sometimes very large.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the vacuum passes over water, the water may rise in a body or column
therein to the height of about thirty-two feet. This whirl of air may be as
invisible as the air itself, though reaching in reality from the water to the region
of cool air, in which our low summer thunder-clouds commonly float;
but it will soon become visible at its extremities. The agitation of the water
under the whirling of the circle, and the swelling and rising of the water
in the commencement of the vacuum, renders it visible below. It is perceived
above by the warm air being brought up to the cooler region, where
its moisture begins to be condensed by the cold into thick vapour; and is then
first discovered at the highest part; which being now cooled, condenses what
rises behind it, and this latter acts in the same manner on the succeeding
body; where, by the contact of the vapours, the cold operates faster in a right
line downwards, than the vapours themselves can climb in a spiral line upwards;
they climb, however, and as by continual addition they grow denser,
and by consequence increase their centrifugal force, and being risen above
the concentrating currents that compose the whirl, they fly off, and form a
cloud.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems easy to conceive, how, by this successive condensation from above,
the spout appears to drop or descend from the cloud, although the materials
of which it is composed are all the while ascending. The condensation of
the moisture contained in so great a quantity of warm air as may be supposed
to rise in a short time in this prodigiously rapid whirl, is perhaps sufficient to
form a great extent of cloud: and the friction of the whirling air on the sides
of the column may detach great quantities of its water, disperse them into
drops, and carry them up in the spiral whirl mixed with the air. The heavier
drops may indeed fly off, and fall into a shower about the spout; but much
of it will be broken into vapour, and yet remain visible.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the whirl weakens, the tube may apparently separate in the middle;
the column of water subsiding, the superior condensed part drawing up to
the cloud. The tube or whirl of air may nevertheless remain entire, the
middle only becoming invisible, as not containing any visible matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Stuart, in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>, says, “It was observable of
all the spouts he saw, but more perceptible of a large one, that towards the
end it began to appear like a hollow canal, only black in the borders, but
white in the middle; and though it was at first altogether black and opaque,
yet the sea-water could very soon after be perceived to fly up along the middle
of this canal like smoke in a chimney.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Dr. Stuart’s spouts were full charged, that is, when the whirling
pipe of air was filled with quantities of drops and vapour torn off from the
column, the whole was rendered so dark that it could not be seen through,
nor the spiral ascending motion discovered; but when the quantity ascending
lessened, the pipe became more transparent, and the ascending motion visible.
The spiral motion of the vapours, whose lines intersect each other on
the nearest and farthest side of this transparent part, appeared therefore to
Stuart like smoke ascending in a chimney; for the quantity being still too
great in the line of sight through the sides of the tube, the motion could not
be discovered there, and so they represented the solid sides of the chimney.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Franklin concludes by supposing a whirlwind or spout to be stationary,
when the concurring winds are equal but if unequal, the whirl acquires a
progressive motion in the direction of the strongest pressure. When the wind
that communicates this progression becomes stronger above than below, or
below than above, the spout will be bent or inclined. Hence the horizontal
process and obliquity of water-spouts are derived.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Water-way</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouttiere</span></i>, a long piece of timber serving to connect the sides
of a ship to her decks, and form a sort of channel to carry off the water from
the latter by means of scuppers. See that article.</p>

<p class='c008'>The convexity of the decks, represented by N, M, N, in the <span class='sc'>Midship-frame</span>,
plate <a href='#VII'>VII</a>. necessarily carries the water towards the sides, where this
piece is fixed, which is principally designed to prevent the water from lodging
in the seams, so as to rot the wood and oakum contained therein.
The water-ways N N are therefore hollowed in the middle lengthways, so as
to form a kind of gutter or channel, one side of which lies almost horizontally,
making part of the deck, whilst the other rises upwards, and corresponds
with the side, of which it likewise makes a part. They are scored down
about an inch and a half, or two inches, upon the beams, and rest upon
lodging-knees or carlings. They are secured by bolts driven from without
through the planks, timbers, and water-ways, and clinched upon rings on the
inside of the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scuppers, which are holes by which the water escapes from off the
deck, are accordingly cut through the water-ways.</p>

<p class='c008'>WAVE, a volume of water elevated by the action of the wind upon its
surface, into a state of fluctuation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Boyle has proved, by a variety of experiments, that the utmost force
of the wind never penetrates deeper than six feet into the water; and it should
seem a natural consequence of this, that the water put in motion by it can
only be elevated to the same height of six feet from the level of the surface
in a calm. This six feet of elevation being then added to the six of excavation,
in the part whence that water was raised, should give twelve feet for
the greatest elevation of a wave, when the height of it is not increased by
whirlwinds, or the interruption of rocks or shoals, which always gives an additional
elevation to the natural swell of the waves.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are not to suppose, from this calculation, that no wave of the sea can
rise more than six feet above its natural level in open and deep water; for
some immensely higher than these are formed in violent tempests, in the
great seas. These, however, are not to be accounted waves in their natural
state; but they are single waves composed of many others: for in these wide
plains of water, when one wave is raised by the wind, and would elevate itself
up to the exact height of six feet, and no more, the motion of the water
is so great, and the succession of the waves so quick, that during the time
wherein this rises, it receives into it several other waves, each of which would
have been of the same height with itself. These accordingly run into the first
wave, one after another as it rises: by this means its rise is continued much
longer than it would naturally have been, and it becomes accumulated to an
enormous size. A number of these complicated waves arising together, and
being continued in a long succession by the duration of the storm, make the
waves so dangerous to shipping, which the sailors, in their phrase, call mountains
high.</p>

<p class='c008'>WAY <i>of a ship</i>, the course or progress which she makes on the water under
sail. Thus, when she begins her motion, she is said to be under way;
and when that motion increases, she is said to have fresh way through the
water. Hence also she is said to have <i>head-way</i> or <i>stern-way</i>. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>WEARING. See the article <span class='sc'>Veering</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>WEATHER is known to be the particular state of the air with regard to
the degree of the wind, to heat or cold, or to driness and moisture.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Weather</span> is also used as an adjective, applied by mariners to every thing
lying to-windward of a particular situation. Thus a ship is said to have the
weather-gage of another, when she is farther to-windward. Thus also, when,
a ship under sail presents either of her sides to the wind, it is then called the
weather-side; and all the rigging and furniture situated thereon are distinguished
by the same epithet; as, the <i>weather-shrouds</i>, the weather-<i>lifts</i>, the
weather-<i>braces</i>, &amp;c. See the article <span class='sc'>Lee</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Weather-bit</span>, a turn of the cable of a ship about the end of the <i>windlass</i>,
without the <i>knight-heads</i>. It is used to check the cable, in order to slacken
it gradually out of the ship, in tempestuous weather, or when the ship rides
in a strong current. See also <span class='sc'>Ring-rope</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Weather-shore</span>, a name given by seamen to the shore lying to the windward.</p>

<p class='c008'>WELL, an apartment formed in the middle of a ship’s hold to inclose the
pumps, from the bottom to the lower deck. It is used as a barrier to preserve
those machines from being damaged by the friction or compression of
the materials contained in the hold, and particularly to prevent the entrance
of ballast, &amp;c. by which the tubes would presently be choaked, and the
pumps rendered incapable of service. By means of this inclosure, the artificers
may likewise more readily descend into the hold, in order to examine the
state of the pumps, and repair them, as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Well</span> <i>of a fishing-vessel</i>, an apartment in the middle of the hold, which is
entirely detached from the rest, being lined with lead on every side, and having
the bottom thereof penetrated with a competent number of small holes,
passing also through the ship’s floor, so that the salt-water running into the
well is always kept as fresh as that in the sea, and yet prevented from communicating
itself to the other parts of the hold.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Well-room</span> <i>of a boat</i>, the place in the bottom where the water lies, between
the ceiling and the platform of the stern-sheets, from whence it is
thrown out into the sea with a scoop.</p>

<p class='c008'>WHARF, a perpendicular building of wood or stone raised on the shore
of a road or harbour, for the convenience of lading or discharging a vessel by

<p class='c008'>WHARFINGER, the person who has the charge of a wharf, and takes
account of all the articles landed thereon, or removed from it, into any vessel

<p class='c008'>WHIP, a sort of small tackle, either formed by the communication of a
rope with a single immoveable block, as fig. 3. plate <a href='#XI'>XI</a>. or with two
blocks, one of which is fixed, and the other moveable, as fig. 5. It is generally
used to hoist up light bodies, as empty casks, &amp;c. out of a ship’s hold,
which is accordingly called <i>whipping</i> them up. See <span class='sc'>Tackle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Whip</span>, is also to tie a piece of packthread, spun-yarn, &amp;c. about the

<p class='c008'>WINCH, a cylindrical piece of timber, furnished with an axis, whose extremities
rest in two channels placed horizontally or perpendicularly. It is turned
about by means of an handle resembling that of a draw-well, grind-stone, &amp;c.
and is generally employed as a <i>purchase</i>, by which a rope may be more conveniently
or more powerfully applied to any object, than when used singly, or
without the assistance of mechanical powers.</p>

<p class='c008'>WIND, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vent</span></i>, a stream or current of air which may be felt; and usually
blows from one part of the horizon to its opposite part.</p>

<p class='c008'>The horizon, besides being divided into 360 degrees, like all other circles,
is by mariners supposed to be divided into four quadrants, called the north-east,
north-west, south-east, and south-west quarters. Each of these quarters
they divided into eight equal parts, called points, and each point into four
equal parts, called quarter-points. So that the horizon is divided into 32
points, which are called <i>rhumbs</i> or <i>winds</i>; to each wind is assigned a name,
which shews from what point of the horizon the wind blows. The points of
north, south, east, and west, are called <i>cardinal points</i> and are at the distance
of 90 degrees, or eight points from one another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Winds are either constant or variable, general or particular. Constant
winds are such as blow the same way, at least for one or more days; and variable
winds are such as frequently shift within a day. A general or <i>reigning</i>
wind is that which blows the same way, over a large tract of the earth, almost
the whole year. A particular wind is what blows, in any place, sometimes one
way, and sometimes another, indifferently. If the wind blows gently, it is
called a breeze; if it blows harder, it is called a gale, or a stiff gale; and if
it blows with violence, it is called a storm or hard gale<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following observations on the wind have been made by skilful seamen:
and particularly the great Dr. Halley.</p>

<p class='c008'>1st. Between the limits of 60 degrees, namely, from 30° of north latitude
to 30° of south latitude, there is a constant east wind throughout the year,
blowing on the Atlantic and Pacific oceans; and this is called the <i>trade-wind</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>For as the sun, in moving from east to west, heats the air more immediately
under him, and thereby expands it; the air to the eastward is constantly
rushing towards the west to restore the equilibrium, or natural state of
the atmosphere; and this occasions a perpetual east wind in those limits.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. The trade-winds near their northern limits blow between the north
and east, and near the southern limits they blow between the south and east.</p>

<p class='c008'>For as the air is expanded by the heat of the sun near the equator; therefore
the air from the northward and southward will both tend towards the
equator to restore the equilibrium. Now these motions from the north and
south, joined with the foregoing easterly motion, will produce the motions
observed near the said limits between the north and east, and between the
south and west.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d. These general motions of the wind are disturbed on the continents,
and near their coasts.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the nature of the soil may either cause the air to be heated or cooled;
and hence will arise motions that may be contrary to the foregoing general
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>4th. In some parts of the Indian ocean there are periodical winds, which
are called Monsoons; that is, such as blow half the year one way, and the
other half-year the contrary way.</p>

<p class='c008'>For air that is cool and dense, will force the warm and rarefied air in a
continual stream upwards, where it must spread itself to preserve the equilibrium:
so that the upper course or current of the air shall be contrary to
the under current; for the upper air must move from those parts where the
greatest heat is; and so, by a kind of circulation, the N. E. trade-wind below
will be attended with a S. W. above; and a S. E. below with a N. W.
above: And this is confirmed by the experience of seamen, who, as soon as
they get out of the trade-winds, generally find a wind blowing from the
opposite quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'>5th. In the Atlantic ocean, near the coasts of Africa, at about 100 leagues
from shore between the latitudes of 28° and 10° north, seamen constantly
meet with a fresh gale of wind blowing from the N. E.</p>

<p class='c008'>6th. Those bound to the Caribbee islands, across the Atlantic ocean, find,
as they approach the American side, that the said N. E. wind becomes easterly;
or seldom blows more than a point from the east, either to the northward
or southward.</p>

<p class='c008'>These trade-winds, on the American side, are extended to 30, 31, or
even to 32° of N. latitude; which is about 4° farther than what they extend
to on the African side: Also, to the southward of the equator, the
trade-winds extend three or four degrees farther towards the coast of Brasil
on the American side, than they do near the Cape of Good Hope on the African
side.</p>

<p class='c008'>7th. Between the latitudes of 4° and 4° south, the wind always
blows between south and east. On the African side the winds are nearest
the south; and on the American side nearest the east. In these seas Dr. Halley
observed, that when the wind was eastward, the weather was gloomy,
dark, and rainy, with hard gales of wind; but when the wind veered to the
southward, the weather generally became serene, with gentle breezes next to
a calm.</p>

<p class='c008'>These winds are somewhat changed by the seasons of the year; for when
the sun is far northward, the Brasil S. E. wind gets to the south, and the
N. E. wind to the east; and when the sun is far south, the S. E. wind gets
to the east, and the N. E. winds on this side of the equator veer more to the
north.</p>

<p class='c008'>8th. Along the coast of Guinea, from Sierra Leone to the island of St.
Thomas, (under the equator) which is above 500 leagues, the southerly and
south-west winds blow perpetually: for the S. E. trade-wind having passed
the equator, and approaching the Guinea coast within 80 or 100 leagues, inclines
towards the shore, and becomes south, then S. E. and by degrees, as
it approaches the land, it veers about to south, S. S. W. and when very near
the land it is S. W. and sometimes W. S. W. This tract is troubled with frequent
calms, violent sudden gusts of wind, called tornadoes, blowing from
all points of the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reason of the wind setting in west on the coast of Guinea, is in all
probability owing to the nature of the coast, which being greatly heated by
the sun, rarefies the air exceedingly, and consequently the cool air from off
the sea will keep rushing in to restore the equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c008'>9th. Between the 4th and 10th degrees of north latitude, and between the
longitude of Cape Verd, and the eastermost of the Cape Verd isles, there is
a track of sea which seems to be condemned to perpetual calms, attended
with terrible thunder and lightnings, and such frequent rains, that this part of
the sea is called the <i>rains</i>. In sailing through these six degrees, ships are
said to have been sometimes detained whole months.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cause of this is apparently, that the westerly winds setting in on this
coast, and meeting the general easterly wind in this track, balance each other,
and so produce the calms; and the vapours carried thither by each wind meeting
and condensing, occasion the almost constant rains.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last three observations shew the reason of two things which mariners
experience in sailing from Europe to India, and in the Guinea trade.</p>

<p class='c008'>And first. The difficulty which ships in going to the southward, especially
in the months of July and August, find in passing between the coast of Guinea
and Brasil, notwithstanding the width of this sea is more than 500
leagues. This happens, because the S. E. winds at that time of the year
commonly extend some degrees beyond the ordinary limits of 4° N. latitude;
and besides coming so much southerly, as to be sometimes south, sometimes
a point or two to the west; it then only remains to ply to windward: And if,
on the one side, they steer W. S. W. they get a wind more and more easterly;
but then there is danger of falling in with the Brasilian coast, or shoals: and
if they steer E. S. E. they fall into the neighbourhood of the coast of Guinea,
from whence they cannot depart without running easterly as far as the
island of St. Thomas; and this is the constant practice of all the Guinea
ships.</p>

<p class='c008'>Secondly. All ships departing from Guinea for Europe, their direct course is
northward; but on this course they cannot proceed, because the coast bending
nearly east and west, the land is to the northward. Therefore, as the winds on
this coast are generally between the S. and W. S. W. they are obliged to steer
S. S. E. or south, and with these courses they run off the shore; but in so
doing they always find the winds more and more contrary; so that when near
the shore, they can lie south; but at a greater distance they can make no better
than S. E. and afterwards E. S. E.; with which courses they commonly fetch
the island of St. Thomas and Cape Lopez, where finding the winds to the
eastward of the south, they sail westerly with it, till coming to the latitude of
four degrees south, where they find the S. E. wind blowing perpetually.</p>

<p class='c008'>On account of these general winds, all those that use the West India trade,
and even those bound to Virginia, reckon it their best course to get as soon as
they can to the southward, that so they may be certain of a fair and fresh gale
to run before it to the westward: And for the same reason those homeward-bound
from America endeavour to gain the latitude of 30 degrees, where
they first find the winds begin to be variable; though the most ordinary winds
in the north Atlantic ocean come from between the south and west.</p>

<p class='c008'>10th. Between the southern latitudes of 10 and 30 degrees in the Indian
ocean, the general trade-wind about the S. E. <i>by</i> S. is found to blow all the
year long in the same manner as in the like latitudes in the Ethiopic ocean:
and during the six months from May to December, these winds reach to
within two degrees of the equator; but during the other six months, from
November to June, a N. W. wind blows in the tract lying between the 3d
and 10th degrees of southern latitude, in the meridian of the north-end of
Madagascar; and between the 2d and 12th degree of south latitude, near
the longitude of Sumatra and Java.</p>

<p class='c008'>11th. In the tract between Sumatra and the African coast, and from three
degrees of south latitude quite northward to the Asiatic coasts, including the
Arabian sea and the Gulf of Bengal, the Monsoons blow from September to
April on the N. E.; and from March to October on the S. W. In the former
half-year the wind is more steddy and gentle, and the weather clearer,
than in the latter six months: and the wind is more strong and steddy in the
Arabian sea than in the Gulf of Bengal.</p>

<p class='c008'>12th. Between the island of Madagascar and the coast of Africa, and
thence northward as far as the equator, there is a tract, wherein from April
to October there is a constant fresh S. S. W. wind; which to the northward
changes into the W. S. W. wind, blowing at times in the Arabian
sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>13th. To the eastward of Sumatra and Malacca on the north of the equator,
and along the coasts of Cambodia and China, quite through the Philippines
as far as Japan, the Monsoons blow northerly and southerly; the northern
one setting in about October or November, and the southern about
May. The winds are not quite so certain as those in the Arabian seas.</p>

<p class='c008'>14th. Between Sumatra and Java to the west, and New Guinea to the
east, the same northerly and southerly winds are observed; but the first half
year Monsoon inclines to the N. W. and the latter to the S. E. These winds
begin a month or six weeks after those in the Chinese seas set in, and are quite
as variable.</p>

<p class='c008'>15th. These contrary winds do not shift from one point to its opposite all
at once; and in some places the time of the change is attended with calms,
in others by variable winds: and it often happens on the shores of Coromandel
and China, towards the end of the Monsoons, that there are most
violent storms, greatly resembling the hurricanes in the West Indies;
wherein the wind is so excessively strong, that hardly any thing can resist its
force.</p>

<p class='c008'>All navigation in the Indian ocean must necessarily be regulated by these
winds; for if mariners should delay their voyages till the contrary Monsoon
begins, they must either sail back, or go into harbour, and wait for the return
of the trade-wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The relative force of the wind upon a ship’s sails, and the epithets by
which it is distinguished, as <i>fair</i>, <i>large</i>, &amp;c. according to the angle which it
makes with her course, are explained in the article <span class='sc'>Sailing</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>WINDING <i>a Call</i>, the act of blowing or piping upon a boatswain’s
whistle, so as to communicate the necessary orders of <i>hoisting</i>, <i>heaving</i>, <i>belaying</i>,
<i>slackening</i>, &amp;c. See the article <span class='sc'>Call</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Winding-Tackle</span>, a name usually given to a tackle formed of three fixed
and two or three moveable sheaves. It is principally employed to hoist
up any weighty materials into or out of a ship, in the exercises of lading and
delivering. See <span class='sc'>Tackle</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>WINDLASS, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vindas</span></i>, a machine used in merchant-ships to heave up the
anchors from the bottom, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The windlass is a large cylindrical piece of timber, fig. 15. plate <a href='#XII'>XII</a>. formed
on the principles of the <i>axis in peritrochio</i>. It is supported at the two ends
by two frames of wood, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, placed on the opposite sides of the deck near
the fore-mast, called <i>knight-heads</i>, and is turned about in this position as upon
an axis, by levers called handspecs, which are for this purpose thrust into
holes bored through the body of the machine. See the article <span class='sc'>Heaving</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lower part of the windlass is usually about a foot above the deck. It is,
like the <i>capstern</i>, furnished with strong <i>pauls</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, to prevent it from turning
backwards by the effort of the cable, when charged with the weight of the anchor,
or strained by the violent jerking of the ship in a tempestuous sea. The
pauls, which are formed of wood or iron, fall into notches, cut in the surface
of the <i>windlass</i>, and lined with plates of iron. Each of the pauls being accordingly
hung over a particular part of the windlass, falls eight times into
the notches at every revolution of the machine, because there are eight
notches placed on its circumference under the pauls. So if the windlass is
twenty inches in diameter, and purchases five feet of the cable at every revolution,
it will be prevented from turning back, or losing any part thereof, at
every seven inches nearly, which is heaved in upon its surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this machine is heaved about in a vertical direction, it is evident that
the effort of an equal number of men acting upon it will be much more
powerful than on the capstern; because their whole weight and strength are
applied more readily to the end of the lever employed to turn it about.
Whereas, in the horizontal movement of the capstern, the exertion of their
force is considerably diminished. It requires, however, some dexterity and
address to manage the handspec to the greatest advantage; and to perform
this the sailors must all rise at once upon the windlass, and, fixing their bars
therein, give a sudden jerk at the same instant, in which movement they are
regulated by a sort of song or howl pronounced by one of their number.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most dextrous managers of the handspec in heaving at the windlass are
generally supposed the colliers of Northumberland: and of all European
mariners, the Dutch are certainly the most aukward and sluggish in this manœuvre.</p>

<p class='c008'>WINDSAIL, a sort of wide tube or funnel of canvas, employed to convey
a stream of fresh air downward into the lower apartments of a ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>This machine is usually extended by large hoops situated in different parts
of its height. It is let down perpendicularly through the <i>hatches</i>, being expanded
at the lower end like the base of a cone; and having its upper part
open on the side which is placed to windward, so as to receive the full current
of the wind; which, entering the cavity, fills the tube, and rushes downwards
into the lower regions of the ship. There are generally three or four
of these in our capital ships of war, which, together with the ventilators,
contribute greatly to preserve the health of the crew.</p>

<p class='c008'>WINGS, a name given to those parts of a ship’s <i>hold</i> which are nearest to
the sides, or farthest removed from the middle of her breadth.</p>

<p class='c008'>This term is particularly used in the stowage of the several materials contained
in the hold; as, Stow the large casks <i>amidships</i>, and the smaller barrels
in the wings. See <span class='sc'>Trim</span> and <span class='sc'>Stowage</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Wings</span> are also the skirts or extremities of a fleet when it is ranged into
a line a-breast, or when bearing away upon two sides of an angle. Thus the
ships a, b. fig. 10. &amp; 11. plate <a href='#V'>V</a>. are in the wings of their fleet or squadron.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usual to extend the wings of a fleet in the day-time, in order to discover
any enemy which may fall into their track. To prevent separation, however,
they are commonly summoned to draw nearer to the center of the squadron
before night, by a signal from the commander in chief, which is afterwards
repeated by ships in the intervals.</p>

<p class='c008'>WOOLDING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">surlier</span></i>, (<i><span lang="nl-nl" xml:lang="nl-nl">woelen</span></i>, Dut.) the act of winding a piece of rope about
a mast or yard, to support it in a place where it may have been <i>fished</i> or <i>scarfed</i>;
or when it is composed of several pieces united into one solid. See <span class='sc'>Mast</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Woolding</span> is also the rope employed in this service. Those which are

<p class='c008'>WORMING, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emieller</span></i>, the act of winding a rope spirally about a cable, so
as to lie close along the interval between every two strands. It is generally
designed to support and strengthen the cable, that it may be enabled to sustain
a greater effort when the ship rides at anchor; and also to preserve the
surface of the cable, where it lies flat upon the ground, near the station of
the anchor: particularly in moderate weather.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Conclusion of the article</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Pump</span></em>.</h4>

<p class='c015'>As we wish to pay all possible attention in this work to every improvement
in the marine, we have exhibited in plate <a href='#VIII'>VIII</a>. a section of this machine
at large, as fixed in a frigate of war, fig. 2. wherein A is the keel,
and V the floor timbers, and X the kelson, <i>a a a</i> the several links of the
chain, <i>b b</i> the valves, C the upper wheels, D the lower wheels, <i>c c</i> the
cavities upon the surface of the wheels to receive the valves as they pass
round thereon, <i>d d</i> the bolts fixed across the surface of the wheels, to fall in
the interval between every two links, to prevent the chain from sliding back.</p>

<p class='c008'>The links of the chain, which are no other than two long plates of iron

<p class='c008'>The subscribers further certify, that the chain of the new pump was
dropped into the well, and afterwards taken up and repaired and set at work
again in two minutes and a half; and that they have seen the lower wheel
of the said pump taken up to show how readily it might be cleared and refitted
for action, after being choaked with sand or gravel; which they are of
opinion may be performed in four or five minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>X.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>XEBEC, a small three-masted vessel, navigated in the Mediterranean sea,
and on the coasts of Spain, Portugal, and Barbary. See fig. 8. plate <a href='#XII'>XII</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sails of the xebec are in general similar to those of the polacre, but
the hull is extremely different from that and almost every other vessel. It is
furnished with a strong <i>prow</i>, and the extremity of the stern, which is nothing
more than a sort of railed platform or gallery, projects farther behind
the counter and buttock than that of any European ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>Being generally equipped as a corsair, the xebec is constructed with a narrow
floor, to be more swift in pursuit of the enemy; and of a great breadth,
to enable her to carry a great force of sail for this purpose, without danger
of overturning. As these vessels are usually very low-built, their decks
are formed with a great convexity from the middle of their breadth towards
the sides, in order to carry off the water, which falls aboard, more readily
by their scuppers. But as this extreme convexity would render it very
difficult to walk thereon at sea, particularly when the vessel rocks by the agitation
of the waves, there is a platform of grating extending along the deck
from the sides of the vessel towards the middle, whereon the crew may walk
dry-footed, whilst the water is conveyed through the grating to the scuppers.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a xebec is equipped for war, she is occasionally navigated in three
different methods, according to the force or direction of the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, when the wind is <i>fair</i>, and nearly astern, it is usual to extend <i>square</i>
sails upon the main-mast; and indeed frequently on the fore-mast: and as
those sails are rarely used in a scant wind, they are of an extraordinary breadth.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the wind is unfavourable to the course, and yet continues moderate,
the square yards and sails are removed from the masts, and laid by, in order
to make way for the large lateen yards and sails, which soon after assume
their place: but if the foul wind increases to a storm, these latter are also
lowered down and displaced; and small lateen yards with proportional sails are
extended on all the masts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The xebecs, which are generally armed as vessels of war by the Algerines,
mount from sixteen to twenty-four cannon, and carry from 300 to 450 men,
two thirds of whom are generally soldiers.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the very complicated and inconvenient method of working these vessels,
it will be readily believed, what one of their captains of Algiers acquainted
the author, viz. That the crew of every xebec has at least the labour
of three <i>square-rigged</i> ships, wherein the standing sails are calculated to
answer every situation of the wind.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>Y.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>YACHT, a vessel of state, usually employed to convey princes, ambassadors,
or other great personages from one kingdom to another.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the principal design of a yacht is to accommodate the passengers, it is
usually fitted with a variety of convenient apartments, with suitable furniture,
according to the quality or number of the persons contained therein.</p>

<p class='c008'>The royal yachts are commonly rigged as ketches, except the principal
one reserved for the sovereign, which is equipped with three masts like a ship.
They are in general elegantly furnished, and richly ornamented with sculpture;
and always commanded by captains in his majesty’s navy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides these, there are many other yachts of a smaller kind, employed by
the commissioners of the excise, navy, and customs; or used as pleasure-boats
by private gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c008'>YARD, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vergue</span></i>, a long piece of timber suspended upon the masts of a
ship, to extend the sails to the wind. See <span class='sc'>Mast</span> and <span class='sc'>Sail</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>All yards are either square or lateen; the former of which are suspended
across the mast at right angles, and the latter obliquely.</p>

<p class='c008'>The square-yards, fig. 1. plate <a href='#IX'>IX</a>. are nearly of a cylindrical surface.
They taper from the middle, which is called the <i>slings</i>, towards the extremities
which are termed the <i>yard-arms</i>; and the distance between the slings and
the yard-arms on each side, is, by the artificers, divided into quarters, which
are distinguished into the first, second, third quarters, and yard-arms. The
middle quarters are formed into eight squares, and each of the end parts is figured
like the frustrum of a cone. All the yards of a ship are square except
that of the mizen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The proportions for the length of yards, according to the different classes of
ships in the British navy, are as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>The diameters of yards are in the following proportions to their length.</p>

<p class='c008'>The main and fore yard five sevenths of an inch to a yard. The topsail,
cross-jack, and sprit-sail yards, nine fourteenths of an inch to one yard. The

<p class='c008'>The lateen-yards evidently derive their names from having been peculiar to
the ancient Romans. They are usually composed of several pieces fastened
together by wooldings, which also serve as steps whereby the sailors climb to
the <i>peek</i>, or upper extremity, in order to furl or cast loose the sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mizen-yard of a ship, and the main-yard of a bilander, are hung obliquely
on the mast, almost in the same manner as the lateen-yard of a xebec,
settee, or polacre. See those articles.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To brace the</i> <span class='sc'>Yards</span>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brasser</span></i>, is to traverse them about the masts, so as to

<p class='c008'>YEOMAN, an officer under the boatswain or gunner of a ship of war,
usually charged with the stowage, account, and distribution of their respective
stores.</p>

<p class='c008'>YOKE, a name formerly given to the tiller, when communicating with
two blocks or <i>sheaves</i> affixed to the inner end of the tiller. It is now applied
to a small board or bar which crosses the upper end of a boat’s rudder at
right angles, and having two small cords extending from its opposite extremities
to the <i>stern-sheets</i> of the boat, whereby she is steered as with a tiller.</p>

of the weight of the bullet, has for some time past been practised by the French in a
much severer service, where the encreasing the velocity of the bullet could not at any time
diminish its effect; the service I mean is battering in breach. For I learn, that of late years
all their breaches, in the different sieges they have undertaken, have been made with this very
charge, that is, their twenty four-pounders have been loaded with eight pounds of powder,
and they have found, that though the penetration of the bullet is less with this charge than
with a larger one, yet the other conveniences attending this smaller charge, are more than,
sufficient to balance that particular.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And here I must observe, that there have not been wanting persons of considerable name,
who have asserted that the velocity of a twenty-four pound bullet was really greater with
eight pounds of powder than with any large quantity, founding their opinion on the ridiculous
persuasion, that whatever quantity was put in, no more than eight pounds of it took
fire; but this supposition is destroyed by their own experiments, and their own reasonings
and later experiments, with greater attention, put it beyond all doubt, that to the larger
charge (at least as far as twenty pounds of powder) there corresponds a greater velocity.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. It is necessary to observe in this place, that Mr. Muller, whose opinion herein has been

<p class='c008'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. The wires of which the needle has hitherto been generally composed, were only hardened
at their ends; now if those ends are not equally hard, or if one end be hardened up higher
than the other, when they come to be put together, in fixing them to the card, that end which
is hardest will destroy much of the virtue of the other; by which means the hardest end will
have the greatest power in directing the card, and consequently make it vary towards its own
direction; and, as the wires are disposed in the form of a lozenge, these cards can have but
little force; so that they will often, when drawn aside, stand at the distance of several degrees
on either side the point from whence they are drawn; for all magnetical bodies receive an additional
strength by being placed in the direction of the earth’s magnetism, and act proportionably
less vigorously when turned out of it. Therefore when these kind of needles are
drawn aside from their true point, two of the parallel sides of the lozenge will conspire more
directly than before with the earth’s magnetism, and the other two will be less in that direction:
by this means the two former sides will very much impede its return, and the two
latter will have that impediment to overcome, as well as the friction, by their own force
alone.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. It is necessary to observe here, that the principal, and indeed the only circumstance in
which Knight’s compasses are superior to those which have hitherto obtained, is, that their
needles being tempered much higher than usual, are thereby enabled to contain a much
greater quantity of the magnetical stream, which is certainly a real advantage. But, on the
other hand, experience sufficiently proves, and truth obliges us to remark, that the methods he
has taken to ballance the card with more accuracy than had been formerly attempted, have
rendered it by far too delicate to encounter the shocks of a tempestuous sea.</p>

December, January, and February, or when the winds blow from the N W. or between the
north and west, the currents set to the S E. or between the south and east.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At Ceylon, from the middle of March to October, the currents set to the southward, and

the monsoon conspiring with the general motion. They run so wrongly in these seas,
that unexperienced sailors mistake them for waves that beat upon the rocks known by the
name of breakers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So for some months after the fifteenth of February the currents set from the Maldivies

<p class='c008'>“On the shore of China and Cambodia, in the months of October, November, and December,
the currents set to the N W. and from January to the S W. when they run with such

<p class='c008'>“At Pulo Condore, upon the coast of Cambodia, though the monsoons are shifting, yet
the currents set strongly towards the east, even when they blow to a contrary point.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Along the coasts of the bay of Bengal, as far as the cape Romania, at the extreme point
of Malacca the current runs southward in November and December.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the monsoons blow from China to Malacca, the sea runs swiftly from Pulo
Cambi to Pulo Condore, on the coast of Cambodia.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the bay of Sans Bras, not far from the Cape of Good Hope, there is a current particularly
remarkable, where the sea runs from east to west to the landward; and this more vehemently
as it becomes opposed by the winds from a contrary direction. The cause is undoubtedly
owing to some adjacent shore, which is higher than this.” <cite>Varenius.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>“The famous machine called the Corvus, was framed after the following manner: They
erected on the prow of their vessels a round piece of timber, of about a foot and a half diameter,
and about twelve foot long; on the top whereof they had a block or pulley. Round
this piece of timber, they laid a stage or platform of boards, four foot broad, and about eighteen
foot long, which was well framed, and fastened with iron. The entrance was long-ways,
and it moved about the aforesaid upright piece of timber, as on a spindle, and could be
hoisted up within six foot of the top: about this was a sort of a parapet, knee high, which
was defended with upright bars of iron, sharpened at the end; towards the top whereof there
was a ring: through this ring, fastening a rope, by the help of the pulley, they hoisted or
lowered the engine at pleasure; and so with it attacked the enemy’s vessels, sometimes on
their bow, and sometimes on their broad-side, as occasion best served. When they had grappled
the enemy with those iron spikes, if they happen’d to swing broad-side to broad-side,
then they entered from all parts; but in case they attacked them on the bow, they entered
two and two by the help of this machine, the foremost defending the fore-part, and those
that followed the flanks, keeping the boss of their bucklers level with the top of the parapet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To this purpose Polybius gives us an account of the first warlike preparations which the
Romans made by sea. We may add, in short, the order, which they observed in drawing up
their fleet for battle, taken from the same author. The two consuls were in the two admiral
galleys, in the front of their two distinct squadrons, each of them just a-head of their own divisions,
and a-breast of each other; the first fleet being posted on the right, the second on the left,
making two long files or lines of battle. And, whereas it was necessary to give a due space
between each galley, to ply their oars, and keep clear one of another, and to have their
heads or prows looking somewhat outwards; this manner of drawing up did therefore naturally
form an angle, the point whereof was at the two admiral galleys, which were near together;
and as their two lines were prolonged, so the distance grew consequently wider and
wider towards the rear. But, because the naval as well as the land army consisted of four
legions, and accordingly the ships made four divisions; two of these were yet behind: Of
which the third fleet, or the third legion, was drawn up front-ways in the rear of the first and
second, and so stretching along from point to point composed a triangle, whereof the third
line was the base. Their vessels of burden, that carried their horses and baggage, were in
the rear of these; and were, by the help of small boats provided for that purpose, towed or
drawn after them. In the rear of all, was the fourth fleet, called the Triarians, drawn up
likewise in rank or front-ways, parallel to the third: but these made a longer line, by which
means the extremities stretched out, and extended beyond the two angles at the base. The
several divisions of the army, being thus disposed, formed, as is said, a triangle; the area
within was void, but the base was thick and solid, and the whole body quick, active, and
very difficult to be broken.” <cite>Kennett Antiq. Rome.</cite></p>

breech, so that when the ball, which is forced into it, is again driven out by the strength of
the powder, it is lengthened about the breadth of a finger, and marked with the riffle of
the bore. This piece has an iron rammer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The barrel of the carabine is three foot long, including the stock. It has a much greater

makes the greater resistance at the first inflammation of the powder, and, giving time for the
whole charge to take fire before it goes out of the bore, it is at length thrown out with
greater force than from the common musket.” <cite>Le Blond’s Elements of War.</cite></p>

or swivel-gun. The match being kindled by the explosion, communicates the flame to the sail
against which it is directed, where the arrow is fastened by means of its bars and springs. As
this is peculiar to hot climates, particularly the West-Indies, the sails being extremely dry, are
instantly inflamed, and of course convey the fire to the masts and rigging, and finally to the

wishes to understand the subject, should refer to the several articles, all of which are inserted
in this work.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. The iron chambers are ten inches long, and 3.5 in diameter. They are breeched against
a piece of wood fixed across the ports, and let into another a little higher. When loaded,
they are almost filled with corn-powder, and have a wooden tompion well driven into their
muzzles. They are primed with a small piece of <i>quick-match</i> thrust through their vents into
the powder, with a part of it hanging out. When the ports are blown open by means of the
iron chambers, the port-lids either fall downward, or are carried away by the explosion.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. The fire-barrels ought to be of a cylindrical form, as most suitable to contain the <i>reeds</i>
with which they are filled, and more convenient for stowing them between the troughs in the
fire-room. Their inside diameters should not be less than twenty-one inches, and thirty inches
is sufficient for their length. The bottom parts are first well stored with short double dipped
reeds placed upright; and the remaining vacancy is filled with fire-barrel composition, well
mixed and melted, and then poured over them. The composition used for this purpose is a
mass of sulphur, pitch, tar, and tallow.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are five holes of ¾ inch in diameter, and three inches deep, formed in the top of the
composition while it is yet warm; one being in the center, and the other four at equal distances
round the sides of the barrel. When the composition is cold and hard, the barrel is
primed by filling those holes with fuse-composition, which is firmly driven into them, so as to
leave a little vacancy at the top to admit a strand of quick match twice doubled. The center
hole contains two strands at their whole length, and every strand must be driven home with
mealed powder. The loose ends of the quick-match being then laid within the barrel, the
whole is covered with a dipped <i>curtain</i>, fastened on with a hoop that slips over the head of the
barrel, to which it is nailed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The barrels should be made very strong, not only to support the weight of the composition
before firing, when they are moved or carried from place to place, but to keep them together
whilst burning: for if the staves are too light and thin, so as to burn very soon, the remaining
composition will tumble out and be dissipated, and the intention of the barrels, to carry
the flame aloft, will accordingly be frustrated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The curtain is a piece of coarse canvas, nearly a yard in breadth and length, thickened with
melted composition, and covered with saw-dust on both sides.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. The reeds are made up in small bundles of about a foot in circumference, cut even at
both ends, and tied together in two places. They are distinguished into two kinds, viz. the
long and short; the former of which are four feet, and the latter two feet five inches in
length. One part of them are singly dipped, i. e. at one end; the rest are dipped at both
ends in a kettle of melted composition. After being immersed about seven or eight inches in
this preparation, and then drained, they are sprinkled over with pulverised sulphur upon
a tanned hide.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. The bavins are made of birch, heath, or other brush-wood, which is tough and readily
kindled. They are usually two or three feet in length, and have all their bush-ends lying
one way, the other ends being tied together with small cords. They are dipped in composition
at the bush-ends, whose branches are afterwards confined by the hand, to prevent them
from breaking off by moving about; and also to make them burn more fiercely. After being
dipped, in the same manner as the reeds, they also are sprinkled with sulphur.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. Quick match is formed of three cotton strands drawn into length, and dipped in a boiling
composition of white-wine vinegar, salt-petre, and mealed powder. After this immersion
it is taken out hot, and laid in a trough where some mealed powder, moistened with spirits of
wine, is thoroughly incorporated into the twists of the cotton, by rolling it about therein.
Thus prepared they are taken out separately, and drawn through mealed powder, then hung
upon a line till dried, by which they are fit for immediate service.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. Port-fires are frequently used by the artillery people in preference to matches, to set fire
to the powder or compositions. They are distinguished into wet and dry port-fires. The
composition of the former is salt-petre four, sulphur one, and mealed powder four. When
these materials are thoroughly mixed and sifted, the whole is to be moistened with a little linseed
oil, and rubbed between the hands till all the oil is imbibed by the composition. The
preparation for dry port fires is salt-petre four, sulphur one, mealed powder two, and antimony
one. These compositions are driven into small paper cases, to be used whenever necessary.</p>

    <div><i>Extract of a letter from the commanding-officer of the artillery at Gibraltar, May 10, 1756.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Happening to mention, before the governor and commodore Edgecumbe, that, in case of
Gibraltar being attacked by sea, howitzers would be of great service, as I did not imagine
any ship’s side proof against a 10 inch shell, fired point-blank, or at a small elevation, with
a full charge of powder; which being thought impossible by most present, it was agreed to
try the experiment: accordingly a target, of about 6 feet square, of an equal strength and
resistance with the strongest part of our largest men of war’s sides, was made, and was just
3 feet thick of solid fir-timber: we fired at it out of a sea-service 10 inch howitzer, at 150
yards distance, and with 10 lb. of powder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The first shell just touched the top of the object, and lodged in the bank of sand behind it;
the second grazed short three yards, and went through the lower corner of the object; but
the third shell gave full satisfaction, going through the very centre of the object, and
entering 5 feet into a solid bank of sand behind it.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. The regulations, with regard to pilots in the royal navy, are as follow: The commanders
of the king’s ships, in order to give all reasonable encouragement to so useful a body of men
as pilots, and to remove all their objections to his majesty’s service, are strictly charged to
treat them with good usage, and in equal respect with warrant-officers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The purser of the ship is always to have a set of bedding provided on board for the pilots,
and the captain is to order the boatswain to supply them with hammocs, and a convenient
place to lie in, near their duty, and apart from the common men; which bedding and hammocs
are to be returned when the pilots leave the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A pilot, when conducting one of his majesty’s ship’s in pilot-water, shall have the sole charge
and command of the ship, and may give orders for steering; setting, trimming, or furling the
sails; tacking the ship; or whatever concerns the navigation: and the captain is to take
care that all the officers and crew obey his orders. But the captain is diligently to observe
the conduct of the pilot, and if he judges him to behave so ill as to bring the ship into danger,
he may remove him from the command and charge of the ship, and take such methods for
her preservation as shall be judged necessary; remarking upon the log-book the exact hour
and time when the pilot was removed from his office, and the reasons assigned for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Captains of the king’s ships, employing pilots in foreign parts of his majesty’s dominions,
shall, after performance of the service, give a certificate thereof to the pilot, which
being produced to the proper naval-officer, he shall cause the same to be immediately paid;
but if there be no naval-officer there, the captain of his majesty’s ship shall pay him, and send
the proper vouchers, with his bill, to the navy-board, in order to be paid as bills of exchange.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Captains of his majesty’s ships, employing foreign pilots, to carry the ships they command
into, or out of foreign ports, shall pay them the rates due by the establishment or custom
of the country, before they discharge them; whose receipts being duly vouched, and sent with
a certificate of the service performed, to the navy-board, they shall cause them to be paid with
the same exactness as they do bills of exchange.” <cite>Regulations and Instructions of the Sea-service,

<p class='c008'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. The regulations with regard to prizes in the royal navy are as follow:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I. When any ship or vessel is taken from the enemy, the hatches are to be immediately
spiked up, and her lading and furniture secured from embezzlement, till sentence is passed upon
her in some court of admiralty, empowered to take cognizance of causes of that nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>“II. The captain is to cause the officers of the prize to be examined; three or more of the
company, who can give best evidence, to be brought to the said court of admiralty, together
with the charter-parties, bills of lading, and other ship’s papers found on board.</p>

<p class='c008'>“V. When a privateer is taken, great care is to be had to secure all the ship’s papers,
especially the commission; but if there be no legal commission found on board, then all the
prisoners are to be carried before some magistrate, in order to their being examined and committed
as pirates.”</p>

<p class='c008'>N. B. The third and fourth articles relate to the finding any of the king’s subjects in the
prizes; and appear unnecessary in this place.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. Weight, or gravity, always operates equally on a falling body; for as it always subsists in
an equal degree, it must perpetually act with equal force, or produce always the same effect
in the same time. So if, in the first instant of falling, it communicates to a body a certain
force sufficient to move a certain space, it must, in every following instant, communicate a
force capable of moving it the like space, and by this means the velocity of a falling body is
every moment accelerated; for if it has one degree the first instant, it will have two the second,
three the third, and so on. Hence it must move different spaces every instant, and by that
means describe the curve-line above mentioned.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. The same gentleman observes, that a ship of two decks, such as are generally all those
of the third and fourth rates, cannot be so strongly connected as one that is furnished with
three: a vessel pierced for 15 guns on one side of her deck must necessarily be very long, and is
sometimes apt to droop at the two ends; or, in the sea-phrase, to <i>break her back</i> under the
enormous weight of her artillery.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. The reader, who wishes to be expert in this manœuvre, will find it copiously described by
several ingenious French writers, particularly L’Hôte, Saverien, Morogues, Bourdé, and Ozane;
who have given accurate instructions, deduced from experience, for putting it in practice
when occasion requires. As it is not properly a term of the British marine, a more circumstantial
account of it might be considered foreign to our plan. It has been observed in another
part of this work<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a>, that the French have generally exhibited greater proofs of taste and
judgment in the sculpture, with which their ships are decorated, than the English; the same
candour and impartiality obliges us to confess their superior dexterity in this movement.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r55'>55</a>. Mr. Robertson, librarian of the Royal Society, favoured the author with an inspection of
several curious remarks concerning the history of modern navigation; in which it appears, that
the most early discoveries with regard to the magnetical variation were made about the year
1570. Mr. Robert Norman, from a variety of observations made by him nearly at that time,
ascertains it to have been 11° 15´ easterly, or one point of the compass.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r57'>57</a>. I had often seen water-spouts at a distance, and heard many strange stories of them, but
never knew any thing satisfactory of their nature or cause, until that which I saw at Antigua;
which convinced me that a water-spout is a whirlwind, which becomes visible in all its dimensions
by the water it carries up with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>There appeared, not far from the mouth of the harbour of St. John’s, two or three water-spouts,
one of which took its course up the harbour. Its progressive motion was slow and unequal,
not in a strait line, but as it were by jerks or starts. When just by the wharf, I stood
about 100 yards from it. There appeared in the water a circle of about twenty yards diameter,
which to me had a dreadful though pleasing appearance. The water in this circle
was violently agitated, being whisked about, and carried up into the air with great rapidity and
noise, and reflected a lustre, as if the sun shined bright on that spot, which was more conspicuous,
as there appeared a dark circle around it. When it made the shore, it carried up with
the same violence shingles, staves, large pieces of the roofs of houses, &amp;c. and one small wooden
house it lifted entirely from the foundation on which it stood, and carried it to the distance of
fourteen feet, where it settled without breaking or oversetting; and, what is remarkable, tho’
the whirlwind moved from west to east, the house moved from east to west. Two or three negroes
and a white woman were killed by the fall of timber, which it carried up into the air,
and dropt again. After passing through the town, I believe it was soon dissipated; for, except
tearing a large limb from a tree, and part of the cover of a sugar-work near the town, I do not
remember any farther damage done by it. I conclude, wishing you success in your enquiry,
and am, &amp;c.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
